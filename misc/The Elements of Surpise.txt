The Elements of Surprise
A d&d diary

Some backstory

There are 3 main people of interest in the town of Springcrest, a small town with not a big population that is focused on farming. Nevertheless they manage to have an inn a tavern and other commodities. The people in question are two humans and one short and stout dwarf. The dwarf’s name is Ulgrimm Abersham, one of the humans is a woman called Alistina Goldengrain and another is a man called Trent Tender (god Vulkur). They are a close knit group. A few things set each of them apart from the others in town. Namely Ulgrimm is a dwarf with a thick beard and a strong stature, who is into forging metal items and praying to his deity Moradin- god of creating. Trent is moody and strange with scars on his body, 12 from where he died on his past lives and holds the power of lightning, granted to him by his deity. And Alistina is a young woman with hair in carrot fur, she is in love with a fire genasi called Salamander, she also holds within her a spark of magical flame. They have done many adventures but one is getting rid of kobolds and impressing Sir Franklin Nogmire, a tax collector. He is a religious man who prays to Pelor, he wears full plate armor and has a lot on his plate. Strong of mind, body and stature he travels around correcting tax. In his current employment are two individuals: A man who has made a pact with a star and a tabaxi looking for a gem of legends. The man is a human named Lothar and the feline often called Stone, but whose whole name is Stone on the Sunlight Shore.

Dear Diary, Session 1

There was a whole year spent in company of Nogmire before returning to Springcrest. Stone and Lothar have a max 4 year contract with Sir Franklin working for him in collecting tax. Village of Skoon. The three collectors have met with a half elf cleric named Ignon a young half elf of only 20 years, he turned out to be a nice person. Due to Lothars strange behaviour and abilities he considers him weird, around him springs of wild magic. He can often been seen praying to his god Istashia a primordial of water. He often quoted his elvish father and his ideals. We four fought a cyclops and won though Nogmire got slapped around. Because he got in the way of our mission by trying to take tax money. Afterward had a tenday free so Stone searched for info about Dzhampal's gem the gem that he has heard of in legends and turns out to have been seen last in Griffincliff. Then we continued on doing Nogmire's orders. The feline heard from a contact that a thief called Finigan Quickfinger had taken credit for taking the gem that he was looking for. He was in the southern part of Peoron,and was not a part of Zhentarim the company of thieves and lowlifes that Stone and Lothar belonged in. After a year of work We amassed 36g each. Ignon's contract ended after that and he returned home to Illia, he welcomes us back anytime.
One year after the Springcrest inhabitants last saw Nogmire.
Alistina met again with fire boy and had a chat, then the dwarf appeared, and in a twist of fate so did Trent. They all caught up with each other. One thing led to another and Salamander made a joke about wanting Alistinas eyebrows, because he himself had none. So she uses her magic and makes his beard grow and morph into his eyebrows. Then they share stories then they go to sleep, trant got really drunk. Stone, Nogmire and Lothar have arrived in town. Stone met up  with the three and  went to have a drink, then to Nogmire with the group.
The three showed interest in joining Nogmire on his quest and they had a test of strength with him, passed thoroughly and got recruited.

Dear Diary, Session 2

Stone and Lothar join the party!
Lothar has been hearing voices, other people’s thoughts, that usually help. In the morning we went to the tavern so that we would buy some drinks for the road. Stone bought a cup and bottle of fire wine and a bottle of honey mead. When he takes his first sip he coughs and chokes a bit and then continues drinking with a mixture of pain and intoxication he finishes the cup. Afterwards they headed to the inn. Mary, the innkeep, asks Alistina for help with a friend called Videl. He locked himself into a room, started talking to himself and had gained some sort of psychic abilities. The party tried to approach but he attacked us all and threw against the far wall. Marie was knocked unconscious. His powers seemed to resonate with Lothar's, who was the only one who didn't try to run. Stone took Mary to a safe place then went back to Lothar, who was having strange moments with Videl. As Videl was attacking Stone fired an arrow into him, which he promptly removed with psychic abilities and then ran. We talked to Mary then had a long rest. We met Videl's sister aka Mary's daughter Ellie, who is allergic to nut. After this we decided to go and talk to Sir Nogmire. We went to a herbalist high elf called Gale, he knew what troubled Videl but couldn't articulate it due to his elven mind it would’ve taken too long. He gave Trent a box wrapped in cloth and sold Stone a Potion of healing for 43 gold pieces. He was really Elvish in acting, to which Stone responded by acting more Elvish himself. While they were doing that Alistina went to say goodbye to the Salamander and had a really heartfelt moment. After that they set off on a couple days travel to Bjorndale because Nogmire recived a falconer message of a dead tax collector and the tax reported stolen.
One time on the journey Stone, Trent, Alistina,  Ulgrimm were sitting around the fire while the rest were sleeping. Then unbenounced to us several creatures were rushing towards us. Combat commences. Stone notices just as one reaches him, dodges an arrow and misses an attack on the creature, the creature turns out to be undead. Ulgrimm smashes the creature with sacred flame. Then gets hit by an arrow and stone gets bitten.
Trent smashes the biter with his warhammer, after which he gets flanked and bitten. Stone then finishes off the first one and Fire girl hits the other with a fire bolt and Ulgrimm finishes it off. The one sniping flees. We debated chasing after it but decided against it. We rest and then arrive at Bjorndale without incident. Trent opens the box given to him by the elven gentleman just to find it containing a potted plant.

Dear Diary, Session 3
Coming up towards our destination we reach Bjorndale. A tax collector was killed both this and the prior year while collecting tax here. A small settlement focused on farming, though it’s partly in the shadow of the mountain Greypeak on the north. To the west of it is Griffincliff and west is Sagecoast. When we approach Bjorndale the sun is on it’s way to set. Nogmire wants us to talk to the mayor. Stone and the others see the mayor's building. They knocked on the door. A slide opened at head level and green eyes were visible. The man behind the door asked of our business, To which we responded ”We are here on Sir Nogmire’s business and would like to talk to the mayor”. The man disappeared for a moment and when he returned he unbarred the door and let us in. We see that the building is in disrepair. The man leads us into a room and we see a bears head on the wall a plack under it says Sir Bearington. We talk to the mayor and ask about the dead tax collector. The body was found on the start of the black road. That was all. After that the rude mayor kicked us out. Stone lead them to the Tavern/small Inn “The Iron Bone” They charge outrageous prices, 5 sp per person 5 cp per horse per night.
In the morning Sir Nogmire charges in with a battle plan. 8 Locations total, Nogmire will take care of 4 the rest the other. The first location is at the base of the mountain. The black road leads there. We head down have the cheapest food, bread and water. And then acquire rations. The man asks us if we want to visit his 10ft pole store. We say no. Outside comes the 10ft pole shop owner. He asks if we want to go inside. We entered the establishment. They had 10 feet poles of EVERY kind. TABAXI 10 FT POLES, FLASK 10 FT POLES, HALFLING 10 FT POLES(LITERALLY JUST A 5 FT 10 FT POLE), A WOODEN 10 FOOT POLE. Needles to say, we left without any poles. On the way to the first local Grimm asks Stone weather he can be stealthy. “Why yes, yes I can” answers the feline. and they have a short chat of abilities and stuff. Finally they reach a burnt carriage and after Stone’s request Alistina takes a look at it “The fire was probably lit after the attack, they seemed to have been ambushed and shot by arrows and the gold dragged off into the direction we were heading anyway. ”. She was praised for her insight and we headed off. We weren’t able to follow the tracks due to the difficult trail. We get to a cave, the first local Nogmire’s map showed. The party entered, they saw two passages the right one was caved in. Suddenly a shot was heard and then we saw the dwarf impaled by two arrows and he fell to the ground. Another arrow flew and hit Stone and a goblin emerged from the shadows and hit him with a blade, downing him. Alis in a burst of flame that swept over all three. A screech was heard as a goblin burst into flame, however Ulgrimm and Stone were not burnt, instead of burning, they felt invigorated by the flame. Wounds healed with the flame and they got up. After which Ulgrimm got hit again and fell down. Stone flanked a goblin and sent an arrow through his head. Luckily the last goblin did not pick a fight and ran away. This allowed for the dwarf to heal peacefully. And Alistina while looking around found a flask on a goblins body and a gigantic hand under the rubble. Stone identified it as a giants hand because of his run ins with a cyclops. the party decided to get some rest to get some health. After a short rest they heard a sound, after a moment THEY emerged. A horde of goblins, only the goblins were odd, they were tiny, like cockroach sized. Alistina fires a firebolt and misses, Stone fired an arrow and missed, grim hit the hoard with his sword. Alistina in a burst of insight Conjured a bonfire on the hoard and burnt them. After which the goblins were thrown out of the hoard and the bodys of the dead goblins enlarged into normal size. The surviving surrounded Grim and he responded by swatting them away. the dead flew and the battle continued, Alistina burnt the hoard and Stone finished them off with his shortsword.
Grimm, now badly wounded, prays to his god for healing and his wounds close. Stone hands the two a hooded lantern.
The party sets off into the left fork with Stone sneaking in front. He saw a single goblin on top of a chest eating an apple. They decided to go in and attack. As soon as Stone readies his bow something strange happens, he starts praising the creature, that has now noticed him. Strange as this is Alice knows what to do and lights the goblin on fire. And the goblin charmes Alistina, who in defiance lights him in fire after Grimm approached and tried to hit him but was charmed ad praised him instead. Stone went in for an attack but the goblin dodged it. After which he was insulted by the goblin but was left unfazed by the silly creature. Then the feline attacks with a shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other he hits it with both. Then a firebolt flies from the newly awake Alistina and hits him. The goblin with a magic means makes Stone fall onto the floor in laughter. Alistina and Grimm, disturbed by this miss their attacks against him. Multiple times, but so does he. The tabaxi in laughter, the dwarf not doing much damage, the human hitting him with firebolt and the goblin missing the dwarf. The fire girl moves closer and burns him. The tabaxi, now recovered tries to offer him fire wine in hopes that he’ll not be able to speak after taking a sip. Sadly not he just hit Stone over the head with the bottle shattering it. Fire wine gone to waste. Grim grapples the oddity. After that Stone strikes an attack with his sword, and misses but comes around with a dagger and strikes the goblin in the chest. He wheels in pain and then dies. Stone screams “YES!” in triumph and opens the chest that the goblin was on, he is swiftly hit with a dart and falls to the ground unconscious. On the inside of the lid was written  “gotcha”. then they rested.

Dear diary Session  3
The session began with us in the cavern, with  a bit of investigation we found out that it is a manmade cave.  We made a fire at night, but then Ulgrimm heard a beastyal sound, quite a distance away. He followed it, out of the party’s range, (at this point their sleeping). Grimm decides to go in deeper alone. At once he saw a large creature eating the bodies of the goblins where they died. He decides to come back to the party and wake them up. A discourse occurs betweens Stone and Grimm. We decided to avoid it and hope it goes away. Then the party talked about what to do. Stone suggested blocking themselves in with some of the fallen debris. so that the creature wouldn't have passage to our resting place. We managed to bar the entrance enough without a disturbance. Eventually the sound stops without much issue. The clerics prayed the others just rested. Alistina just dreams the words: ”Through ice and fire you will reach the peak.  Through wrath and grief you will reach/behold pride. All for wealth you dare not attain. ”  The team talked for a bit and discussed of their next local. Namely the old forge, shouldn't be too far off the path they took time off down for a couple of hours due to Vulkur. Grimm congratulated him on his speed and Stone was unimpressed. They arrived at a building, dwarven by design. They all saw a swarm of humanoids, while the mountain was in shade, they were recognised as kobolds. Trent suggest engaging, alistina suggests scouting the area. They decided that Stone would investigate the area, there were a few kobolds and traps. After the scouting they decided decided to sneak up on the gnobolds. The party manages to get within 50ft of them, whilst hiding behind some rocks. Stone suggests he scouts the area for the tax. The others think that killing the kobolts seems more beneficial. There were four kobolts outside, Stone decides to sneak up. He fails miserably. the others don't even get to follow in time. Roll for initiative. Stone is the fastest. He fires an arrow towards the enemies but it clashes off the armor. Alistina asks Grimm for protection. After which stone gets slapped in the face by a kobald stone and them Grimm. grimm strikes the nearest kobold with his warhammer and he YEETS off the ledge. Inspired by this Stone Shoots one in the head and Alistina burn the third one. The last one tries to run away. Stone tries to stealthily follow him but gets slapped in the face with a sling. Stone retreats behind a corner, nearly dead. he peeks around the corner and misses his arrow. He pleads trent for a heal. Trent covers a long area with a cloud and blocks a lot of vision while Grimm gives Stone a pep talk. Alis shrouds herself in flame. Stone rushen through the shadow after hearing a kobolg go down by a clerics hand. and then gets hit by 3 sling shots and is downed. Trent rushes our, kills a kobalt and then heals the tabaxi. Alistina gets exhausted burning the kobold while they attack back. Alistina emols all except one kobolt and stone swiftly finishes him off. Many words of gratitude are shared, after which a whimpering is heard from a back room. grimm found a dead kobold carrying a gemstone, unrare for a kobold, stone recognises it as a topas. Alistina finds another kobold and enters the pillar in the middle to head pat it. The kobold is comforted and doesn’t want to die. Grimm tries to reach for his warhammer but is persuaded by his allies. Due to Alice’s charismatic personality we found out that the kobolds were driven out by the hill giants and some infernal creatures afterwards. He was interrogated by the dward abuóut if they had robbed the carriage and the infernal fire creatures. The fire creatures came from the pits and most the kobolds never came back, and then we came there and absolutely slaughtered them. “that’s unfortunate”- Ulgrimm. Then the kobalt escapes, at the same (grimm and trent play rock paper scissors to see who goes next, grimm won on the second round). The flaming inferno dashes towards the dwarf and FUCKING ENGULFS HIM IN AN INFERNO and burns him into the ground. Trent saves the dying. Alistina exhausts another exhaustion to heal Grimm and Stone. He tries to strike the creature but misses. The creature strikes at him, almost killing Stone. Then as retribution Stone strikes at the creature killing him. What they didn’t know was that the creature would explode upon death and they were exploded, downing Stone. Afterwards they helped a thoroughly exhausted Alistina inside the building and dragged the tabaxi inside. Over an hour he regains some vitality and colour returns into his eyes. After the end of the rest, a creature gets through the barricade and got killed, it exploded and exposed an alleyway. Stone went in to have a look and found dead kobolts and a river of fire.  Grimm walks in and gets ambushed by another fire boy. THe ambusher fuckin yeets at the dwarf and downs him. Alistina walks in, kills the fire boyo and the explosion downs Stone and Ulgrimm. Then the girl awakens the feline, who carries the dwarf away from danger. Then he snaps awake in a fit of lucidity and throughs a bolt at the flame creature desitegrateing it. Then the party reluctantly followed Trent over the bridge and saw found symbols. One symbol is a symbol that summons the flame monsters. Grimm recognises it at once. Thanks to his guidance Stone disarms it with one swift movement. Trent and Grimm fire a spell overloading and finally destroying the rune. luckily it was the only eventful thing. At that point the party decided to go back to the town. The thunder boy leads us down a path and we encounter a giant snek. The snek is eating a bore, but they manage to avoid it. They manage to get to the town, eat some food and get some long deserved rest. Trent dreams of his god, Grimm of his metal and Alice has generally nice dreams. Stone had dreams, but not many. He remembered Grimm’s gem and rummages through his belongings and finds the topaz. He decides to talk with Grimm about polishing the gem and selling it at the jewelers guild. Grimm talks to a store manager and shit happens, grimm learns of alights upon the mountain and possible dragons as the cause.

Dear Diary Session 4
We had a day downtime to heal. Grimm gave out the metal bars with insignias on them that he found. 6 bars of metal each worth 25 gp. Everyone gets 1 bar and the rest is backup money. Alistina wishes to buy a whip, one with a flaming tip.
Stone decides to search the town for a day, he finds an old woman associated with the Zhentarim by tracing the signs only rogues can trace. They talk with thieve’s can’t and have to conversations at once Stone sells his bar to the woman, while to normal observers it seemed to be Stone buying some fabrics. The lady stealthily switches the bar for a pouch of gold. He gains 25 gp and a cloak. The fourth day of the Nogmirian tenday. Trent leads the party through the woods,where we encounter a flock of goblins, as an arrow whizzes through the air and misses trent’s face.
roll for initiative
Stone spots them immediately in a nearby bush. He fires an arrow at them but then gets hit by one and nearly dies. Grimm rushes forward and heals stone and then fires flame toward the bush, burning the green abominations. They fire massive volleys of arrows at the party and hit all of them. A goblin ambushes trant and downs him. Alistina burns the goblin that stone injured and burns him, igniting the bush they were hiding in. Grimm now rushes toward Alis and Trent and burns a GNOBLIN. Another goblin attacks trent. An arrow flies through the air and hits him through the head. The first goblin hits trent with a blade and emolts and explodes as trent faints. Alistina fires a bolt of flame at Trent, healing him. The rest of the goblins escape. Grimm gives his pal a pat on the back and they go on.
It starts raining heavily so they decide to take a rest and recuperate, they waited in the cavern full of lava where the destroyed rune was and get some warmth. After they were done they spend the rest of the day travelling. 4 days left. Trent and Stone are visibly exhausted. We arrive at a narrow road, one side a cliff and the other a wall. Grimm looks at the wall. He sees a hidden door and a shit door. Stone pushes the hidden door open, because he was freezing. The door opens into a natural tunnel with three split paths. Alis casts light on trent’s shield. Stone looks through the path and sees they’re interconnected and finds a pit trap covered by a tarp. He finds two more, but then giant rats appear from the places he removed the tarp. Stone throws food and they gather on a spot, alice lights it up and some rats take damage.
roll for initiative
Then the rats pounce on Stone instantly downing him. Grim slams the one on top of him into the wall killing it and trent receccitates Stone. and smashes another rat. As the last one tries to escape He slashes through it and kills it. They took turns having watch and had a good rest. Then they explore the cavern A large cavern with ice on it’s floor. There lied two giants on it’s floor with giant axes , killed in battle, probably by each other.  At the back of the room lied a diamond on a pedestal, glowing faintly. Stone had an idea on what it does. He supposed that it made the giant’s fight each other. He warned of this and then they approached.
roll for initiative.
Three green orbs appear. Three of us are instantly immobilized. The orbs are attacking, Stone and trent are downed and then brought back up. Alis fires a bolt at the diamond on the pedestal and Trent destroys it by throwing a hammer. Ending the green orbs. As the green orbs fades the party feels an attack on their minds. Alistina gets cursed
Victim of Greed. You were stung by greed, and your soul has been infected by the deadly sin. When you’re in the presence of great wealth in the form of coins or gems/ jewelry worth over 1,000 gp, you are stunned until the end of your first turn, as your mind reels at such great wealth.
The party decides to set off on the journey, but before that, Grimm wanted to check the small, shitty door for traps and Stone tried to assist. They were struck by lightning and stone was downed, he was even more exhausted than before and had to take it slow. They travelled to their last destination and decided to scout out the area and then rest.
________________
Dear diary session 5
The session begins with us passing through the clouds, we arrive at the top part of the mountain. We see a gigantic bell on the path ahead and besides it a mallet. As we continued on the same road, one half was a cliff and the other a wall. Grimm inspects the writings on the wall, still infernal, a religious text perhaps. Though he recognises a name: Annam. As Grimm inspects the writing, GIANT OWLS APPEAR.
Roll for initiative
The three owls descend upon us but we dodge just in time. Then they hover 30 foot above us. The dwarf extends his hand throwing a burst of flame upon one of them and Stone follows up with an arrow, bloodying the creature. The three owls strike down at us again, though mostly at Grimm, but he deftly dodges them all. In retribution he extended his hand on the owl bursting the creature from the inside. Stone shoots at one still in the sky and Alistina finishes it off with a bolt of fire, melting it. We all take potshots at the owl and it us. Until the fire girl burns the owl to a crisp.
The party looks at the birb and decides it’s not decently edible. Grimm decided try to cut off a claw, Stone hands him a dagger, it goes poorly. They stepped onwards towards the cave and bell. The feline now approaches with grace and peers around the corner. Only to see a magical blue shimmer, from floor to ceiling. Grimm tries to remember anything about the barrier but is stumped. The rogue goes over to the brass bell inspecs it and then crawls under the bell, he sees etched into it in common: “What doubles when you share it, is unseen but gives power, but is useless unless practiced.” He then shares this query to his friends. They discuss the problem Stone thinks it might be knowledge. Grimm goes over to inspect the mallet. Alise tries to go through the barrier but gets shunted out. They come to think that striking the bell is the only course of action. So, Ulgrimm brings up the mallet striking the bell whilst yelling “KNOWLEDGE!”, with a big DUNNNNNN the forcefield dissipates. And Stone steps through the place where the forcefield once was. HE FEELS… nothing and passes through. As Grimm decides it is a good place to sit down and recuperate. Afterwards they continue down the cave, clearly manmade. The cavern opens up on a humongous cavern 50 foot high. There were four braziers in the room, large and looming. At the end of the room was a gigantic stone slab at least seventeen feet tall. Blackened by time and worn. On the walls lay paint destroyed by time unrecognizable in this age. Alis goes around lighting the Braziers. Stone mentions how this might be a ritual room for the race of giants like those whose bodys they saw earlier.  As that happens the last one ignites by itself and a high pitched screech is heard.
roll for initiative
The screech gets closer as two tiny implike creatures appear. Made from ice, with wings on their backs. Stone instantly shoots one of them with an arrow, followed by Grimm charging in and smashing it to pieces, and the shards fly into him. The other one approaches and slashes at him and almost kills him, to which Alistina bursts it apart with minimal effort. The shards on the floor melt, instead of dissipating the water evaporates becoming two steam creatures. They attack Grimm, who is nearly dead but keep missing, then they fire a steam so hot at the group that the dwarf gets downed. Alistina brings him back with a bolt of healing flame. And is downed by another blast of steam. Stone then forces a healing potion down Grimms throat. Almost crying now since this was the one he spent his year’s worth of wages on. Grimm gets up and smashes one of the misty apparitions  after Stone fired an arrow into it. It explodes, the dwarf takes damage, but not too much. And with a bit of work the other dies as well.
As combat ends Stone falls to the floor and cries a bit: “You better pay me back!” he says to Grimm and gives him a hug, clearly happy he’s alive. After that little commotion is over they scout the rest of the room. They look around the gigantic slab. Nothing around it, but they decide that grimm will climb it and see what’s on top. They try to boost him up and succeed after he removed his armor and weapon. On the slab he saw three golden plates with an engraving of praying hands. He sets down a silver on all three plates. Stone senses something out of place and turns around. He sees IT. A GIANT CREATURE  standing 20 feet tall. His voice boomed as he questioned them of their reason for being there. Stone bowed and reported that they were there for refuge but were attacked by the owl and impling. His name was Kradokk. He answered the questions of the dwarf and others and allowed to rest in the altar of the headgod: Annam, until they’re rested. He tells the others about the history of giants and the god. As he leaves and Grimm turns around once more, only to see two potions of health. He gives one to Stone, now his debt is paid, Stone threw three gold coins as an othering on the gold plates. They rest up in the altar room. A well needed rest.
3 days remaining. The party is more rested. Alice dreams of a fistfight between a giant and Sir Nogmire. Grimm notices something unusual, namely he can read the strange writing on the walls. They head out the cave and down the mountain. As they move through the clouds, they see humanoids dancing on the clouds, unsure how far they are and how big. They run to hide in foliage and behind a stone. As they approach Stone recognises them as Aarakocra, they fly overhead and one gives a wave at Grimm. They then continue downwards down the mountain. They get to the village without much incident. They get back to town Stone very very exhausted and Grimm exhausted. They had a tenday of downtime to do with as they please. Stone spends his time refining the gem given to him by Grimm. Alistina decides to make rope, at the weaver, the same one that was with the Zhentarim. Grimm spends his time working in the smithy making weapons. At the end of the tenday a figure gallops down the street, it’s Nogmire. He travels to the bar, with the party, tax in tow. He tells of Nogmirian adventure and rambles on and on about tax. He says that they’ve spent far enough time in Bjorndale and need to go to Farnest. Founded by a Aaracockra, though they’re not present anymore. The mayor used to be Ragnar. Then they prepare to set off, Stone gets equipment and Grimm gets alcohol. Sone gives Grimm a gp to get him something and he buys him a bottle of pepperbox and Nogmire a bottle of spirits. Thus the Nogmire gang prepare to set off, awaiting another journey.
________________
Dear Diary Session 6
On the road, Stone is holding the reigns of the horses, leading them down the Black road through the desert. After a long day, they approached an oasis. The oasis is filled with caravans, merchants. They inquire about the oasis from two nearby tieflings, who turns out are protectors of the caravans. They ask the party about talking to their leader Azam about joining them. At sundown, with Nogmire snoring, they went into the tent, noticing him. A dragonborn of many colours surrounded by people. As the Nogmirian company enter, he beckons toward them. They sit in front of the leader ang get straight to business. Azam asks them about being adventurers and if they’d like to join them to the way to Farnest, after it is established that that is also the Nogmire gang’s location. They decide to ask Nogmire in the morning. They were offered a creamy concoction, a milky alcoholic drink sweet in taste. Called mystel. Trent and Stone were drunker than a bard on Correllon. Stone asks about the people and themselves. He learns a bit about the people, one of the merchant’s child is studying to be a Bard in Cynebrym named Shervarra, the child of Vladislak Chergob. Trent hears a story on the reaches of cynabrym with icy claws, where lives a which, who rides around on the winter. The main defence from this is a wizard. In the morning they hear of a recent crisis in which a statute protecting the village. A man asked the caravan to hire a woodworker and create a new one and send it to Farnest. The party asks the finally awake Nogmire if he would agree to them escorting and travelling with the merchants, but before he makes sure their priorities are straight, on the tax. They travel for a long time without any incident. They take the morning watch. The caravans settle in a circular pattern with the goods set inwards. This goes on for a while. One night they hear a screech, a caravan driver was killed by the goblins, with a screech in the night.
roll for initiative
Two goblins strike out at trent, but are burnt by alistina and cut down by stone. Then they approach the big goblin and strike them down one by one. Stone gets downed once but then brought back up.
________________


Dear diary Session 7


The party sets out across the black road through the badlands with the caravan after last week's discrepancy with the goblins. They travel some time before Trent's spidey sense starts tingling. He whips his head around and notices a massive tower on top of a cloud rushing towards them. The cloud drags a sandstorm of sharp rocks and sand behind it as it rushes across the sky.
Stone takes the reigns of their cart as Trent attempts to guide them out of harm's way as they realize the sand will act like splinters of glass and tear the caravan to shreds. In an attempt to secure an important statue of Saint Dagda from being destroyed in the storm, Grimm tries to jump between their cart and that of the stone mason in front of them but loses his balance and falls off the cart, being trampled by the horses in the process.
Alis jumps into action and flings herself off the cart without any regard for her life or a plan to back them up. Stone and Trent continue to lead the cart out of the danger zone at high speeds. With no time left to go and no cover to be found, Grimm shields Alistina the best he can with his body and shield as the storm hits.


Once the dust settles, she thanks him and heals up his cuts a bit, though his shield is completely devastated. Meanwhile, the caravan was unable to outrun the storm and it seems most of the horses are dead and the carts overturned. Trent and Stone dig out the survivors and the party meets up again, trying to fix the cart the best they can before continuing on with one horse.
Exhausted and with limited supplies the group arrives at a passage to Farnest and are blocked by a group of hobgoblins who demand a large fee for passage.
Sir Nogmire, always out on the hunt for taxes, confronts the goblins as they probably have not paid their taxes. An exchange takes place that doesn't seem to be going anywhere and Alis grows tired of it, lobbing a fireball at the leader of the hobgobbos.
A fight breaks out where (as usual) many levels of exhaustion are taken, though the group comes out victorious. It seems that half the hobgoblins present were actually cardboard cutouts already dead before they arrived, having perished in the storm and being propped up by the remaining goblins to look imposing. The party takes a rest in the goblins hideout and discover a large stash of weapons and armour which is quickly absorbed by Trent and Grimm. A short travel later, they arrive in Farnest and bid Azam farewell, obtaining a favour in the process.

Dear diary session 8
Ragnar- tavern owner. daughter, new ale basic. We sit in a tavern called The Golden Tankard. food drink. No one goes hunting in the forest. Grimm goes to the mason while waiting for his food. there is a halfling. Grimm sits across tiefling woman and next to the mason. Nogmire sneezes, Alistina blesses. Ragnar wanted to hold a feast in the town square to celebrate the arrival for the statue. We need to go the forest for big gain. An older man behind Nigmire is outraged, and says ?ot to drag the travellers into this, ragnar not being up to any good. there being a rumor of people going missing in the forest. An older woman raises her voice and a large scale dispute. After a long discussion and no solid evidence of this. Grim went to accept and Stone offered Alis some honeymead. They look for supplies, Stone gets a hunting trap, oil and bath oil. They set off to the woods to hunt some game. travel for a bit and arrive through a misty fog. As they progress they hear some music and see a satyr. He introduces himself as Blassios Grimm offers him some fire wine. Blassios, not wanting to embarrass himself in front of the lady Alistina, who he’s clearly taken interest to takes a sip. Instantly goes red in the face and pops out of existence, dropping his mug. They look around and call for him, not finding the creature. They decide to track some deer and hunt it. Trent goes on all fours and speeds forward seeing footprints, Stone dashes and catches up to him and jumps on him, in a while see one. Trent tries to eat a snail using the same tactics as a crocodile. Stone goes into a tree and readies his bow, he lets loose and arrow, not targeting any of it’s vital organs, as this might be a fey forest and it an inhabitant. As it turns out he was correct as the king of the forest, what looks like a fairy. It turns out to be the king of this forest, he assesses the animal and Grimm approaches apologizing profusely. The king of the forest was understanding and clapped his hands calling his subordinate Blasseios. He shows the party a hunting ground with giant boars, who the party then kills, then however appear these doglike creatures, called Gnolls. They damage the party but are taken down. They return with the bodies of the boars in time for the feast.

Dear diary session 9
The session begins as the gnolls, these doglike creatures attack. More than a handful, with one riding a giant hyena. The hyena and it’s rider attack, landing on the tables, they down Stone twice and kill some villagers. Trent heals Stone and goes to a well and saves a villager. Grimm smashes the hyena and Stone slashes at it creating deep gashes, as Alistina finishes it off firing a fire bolt into its mouth. The other gnolls are picked off one by one and as two approach Alis. A figure comes flying in, it is the satyr Blassios, he stomps on one of them and pulls out his rapier and stabs some, at the same time trying to appeal to the crimson haired woman praising both her and himself. Meanwhile Stone and Ulgrimm are taking out the one that was on the Hyena and waving a flag. Some strike at Nogmire, but he shrugs the attacks off and cleaves through them. Stone accidentally throws his shortsword and it lands in the already dead body of a bystander. The last one’s are defeated and people come back. They are arguing, naming names, telling Ragnar it was a bad idea asking us to hunt for game. After that Stone goes and takes a bath, smelling really nice and herbal. Grimm goes to the forge to forge and has visions of his father and cries a bit. Blassios asks Alis if she would like to go with him and take a look at his log, she follows, we find her a day later smelling nice and covered with flowers. She has no memory of where she’s been and the party has been really worried. They spend some money training, Grimm praying and smithing, Alistina weaving fine clothes, Trent muttering: “lightning”, and Stone doing serious sidestepping as they gain a level. They go back on the road and pass through a village of halflings and Stone buys some more alcohol. Stone every other day goes for a run and returns in the evenings. When he’s not running he’s working on the gem.

Dear Diary, session 10
Trent disappeared while they were on the travels in a flash of lightning nowhere to be found. He spent a week in the abyss of the ocean. He then reappeared. They travel for two months in the icy cold through woods toward a cliff face. In the next province over a place called Avarict. The party enters the town from the south, a thick wood surrounding the town built onto a cliff face. Next to the tavern called the seven tables. Everyone heads in the hare and hair Inn. They went to buy some general goods and heard about two trappers Alina - 8 months pregnant with his husband and a whip, wears a pin with a raven, being gone for a tenday. The taxes in this part were taken care of by Burgomaster Ivan Randovich. Who apparently has been collecting quite heavily, and yet none of this has been reaching Nogmire’s employer’s. There are toymakers in town Golvia and Lucian Faline, though their child Isabella died. They decide to go onward and found a cart impaled by a tree. On the interior of the tambourine “Family is the Cruelest Curse” Is written in blood. There were bloody tracks which drew deeper. They find a hedge wall, Trent goes through and awakens an undead seeming plant creature and its minions which they then fight and end. Further down the road they come across an elf and two halflings. They seem to be lost and ask the party for directions. They were provided, also with an offering of drink. The halflings seemed excited at the prospect of blerry. The female elf inspired Stone and they set off on their ways. The party then encountered a cave on the side of the hill and climbed into it and found a diary of what they assume correctly to be a lycanthrope named Alina. Stone makes a makeshift alarm in the entrance of the cave. “She feels the cold, Laslo and the child meet her.” “Laslo cut her and she killed him and brought her child to the city” “the only cure is solitude”

Two wolves appear, the alarms alarming the party who notice a gash on one of them.  They then notice the adventurers and pounce the dire wolf striking into Stone and the lycanthrope striking into Grimm and him shrugging it off. They get burnt by Alice and baned by Trent as Stone rushes behind the lycanthrope and pours oil on it. It does not like that as it bites into Stone(cursing him with lycanthropy). Alistina sees this and lights the oil, burning the lycanthrope. They concentrate on the dire wolf.  Burning, smashing and crushing it. Alistina pulls out her whip intimidatingly. The dire wolf recoils in fear and strikes Trent and the lycanthrope strikes Stone again, downing him. Grimm smashes his warhammer against the dire wolf and Alistina whips it to death. Trents gets Stone up with some magical words, who then slashes the lycanthrope three times. The lycanthrope, angry at Alis for killing her kid bites into her and infects her with lycanthropy. In a burst of energy Grimm smashes in the head of the lycanthrope. The body starts convulsing and slowly turns into that of a human. Alistina goes to the entrance. And they prepare to rest. The maelstrom of ice gets colder outside. They sleep in the cold, cold cavern and set out in the morning. They travel for hours upon hours in the freezing weather. In their travels, they hear low moans followed by crashes. They notice a strange light in the forest. As it notices them it disappears. It appears directly on the path they need to go, it floats closer, this ball of yellow. Stone waves to the party indicating them to make way for it. They step next to the road letting it past and continue on their way. Every once in a while they notice the little light far behind them. Grimm asks Stone to keep an eye on it. They continue their travels through the icy weather, the orb getting closer and further and closer seemingly on a whim. When it approaches close Stone signals them to let it past. They step off the road and suddenly the snow beneath them gives way and they all prone as Grimm rolls down a decline pulling trent along with him.
roll for initiative
The orb then goes to Alis and shocks her as a burst of fire burns it. She then gets shocked again and gets downed. Stone strikes at the small orb but misses. Grim hurles a guiding bolt at it and Trent heals Alistina. The orb enters her hooded lantern and disappears. They then continue on their way to town and reach it successfully. Grim knocks on the Hare and hair door and the party is left inside. Gregorious welcomes them inside. Grim fills gregorious in on what they found out. The puppy he had is now lost. They enter the tavern and see Nogmire waving them over. Aya and the halflings have arrived safely. Stone gives Nogmire the rundown on what has happened. Then he goes and takes a long warm bath with his bathing oil, Grimm goes drinking, Trent goes drinking, Alis goes to bed.

Dear Diary, session 12
Stone is drinking Blerry with the halflings Erm and Nim. Aia, the elf, is singing songs and performing. Aia asked the feline for any stories he might have. He answers with two stories of Nogmire’s group. As thanks she .tells him one as well.
Dzhampal master of the flail, drunk till kegs were emptied, fought till the opponents begged. He once lost to a one armed man, he cursed to the world the man and the gods in rage, the gods cursed him, to always thirst for the water of life, he drank and drank and drank people and alcohol, he was then slain by the same one handed hand, but came back as the first vampire, Dracula. He raised an army and was sealed in a gem to seal the evil, that was then guarded by the Lythily royal family. The gem was stolen and now a master magician is looking for it.
Grimm disapproves a bit at the story, not liking the idea of vampires and the two halflings laugh in disbelief claiming they aren't even real. Grimm tells her of the party’s travels their meet with a gold dragon and a storm giant. And finally of their travels with the caravan.  Meanwhile Alistina spends her time talking to the Will’o wisp, named Erhart, who strangely enough talks back.
Stone hears that a new guy in town with a wolf skin cap, who only speaks to Gregory and smells strangely, called Arik. Grimm heard that the blizzard was a curse placed on the town by the Vistanim gypsies.
In the morning the people are greeted by a bright morning, Nogmire is up bright and early, speaking to the innkeep. While on the way there a woman steps in the party’s way. They find out that they need to talk to the gypsiesypsies to learn about lycanthropy and Nogmire informs them about Burgomaster not being present. The party moves on to the gypsies. The rest of the page looks torn off

Dear Diary, session 13
The party is walking through a forest when a twig slaps Alistina across the face, when Grimm helps her up he sees a face carved into a tree, clearly old and ancient, they continue to a Moslavarics camp. A tall man approaches, wearing smith’s clothes. He asks the party of their business, to which Alis responds donani sending them to check up on his fiané, to give her a gift and make sure the outcast Hanzi doesn’t steal the girl Lela. The man says it’s too late, as Hanzi has already run off with her. Alistina walks to the Vardu(tent) the interior is filled with many herbs of various kinds mainly hanging garlic. Looking around for what might have been made with it, Stone finds a bunch of love letters from Hanzi and reads them out loud for any clues. A particular line stands out “I would give anything for you, even my life”. Trent notices tracks leading from the Vardu, They follow the tracks, they encounter a humanoid figure in the woods. Stone sneaks along the side to see the creature better. It's a dark figure, she snow around it undisturbed, as if it hasn’t moved for a long time. Stone throws a rock at a nearby tree, trying to gauge its reaction. seeing it move at the sound he slinks back to the party and asks them to go around it. As he says this Grimm notices black tendrils swarming around them. “AN AMBUSH!” he yells.
Roll for initiative
A shadow strikes out at trent lashing with its claws missing. Alis fires a fire bolt at another, Grimm attacks one of the four. Stone, hidden from a creature, pulls back an arrow, releasing it with such force it explodes the shadow upon impact. Another shadow strikes Trent, sapping some of his vitality, to which Alis replies with healing him and burning two of them. Stone lets loose another arrow at a shadow, as he slinks into the shadows. One of them strikes at trent downing him and sapping his strength. Grimm slaps one of the shadows in retaliation ending it. Healing trent. Stone slashes the last shadow in half and they rest there.
They continue following the tracks and find a clearing filled with standing stones. They find Lela in front of an altar with a tied up man, chanting something in an ancient language. She looks bestial in nature, sharp teeth, sharp claws, vampire spawn.


Roll initiative
Stone flanks in a burst of speed and embeds an arrow in her armpit. She, with the same burst of speed she lunges at Stone slashing twice, downing him. Grimm runs closer and heals Stone, who then retreats. Trent throws a spell at her, getting her attention as Alis misses with a fire bolt. Lela lunges at Trent, doing quite the damage. Stone shoots at her as Grimm releases the restraints on Hanzi. She grabs him as he gets loose from the altar and she slices at trent and Grimm. She then bites into Hanzi consuming his life force. As she does this she mutters the last incantation as her form starts turning back into that of a human’s. When she’s transforming a burst of fire erupts as Alistina burns her to a crisp. They talk for a bit and Alis lays a coat on the burnt naked vampire spawn. Trent and Grimm grab the bodies and the party starts heading back to the camp. They arrive in the dead of night. People see them arrive with two bodies, they are eyed as the old woman arrives with her husband. She leads them inside and introduces herself as Tayrizha. Stone and Alis tell her what happened and why. The old woman is distraught, she informs the party that Lela must’ve turned in one of two places. Aberickt a larger town Grinth a small town of but a few houses, they also gain jewelry and valuables, two hundred gold in worth. They start heading back to the first camp. Then they rest.

Dear Diary, session 14
The party sets back to the town, after a long walk they arrive back to The Seven Tables Inn. Grimm hears a few rumors, of Laslo faking his death, and Burgomaster returning home secretly. The absence of Nogmire surprises Stone who inquires of his  presence. The innkeep Marku tells him that Nogmire has gone to check up on his nephew, who hasn’t returned though he should’ve. They should have returned up the Southern road. Stone buys a drink as thanks As he hears Alistina and Aia yell to each other about the party’s name. Stone turns to the two and says, “Aren’t we the tax collectors”, and is met with a disgruntled sigh from Alis.  As they discuss names further. In the midst of conversation Stone lights up as he says “The Elements of Surprise” this however is responded to nicely, and Trent tried to pet him he accidentally gives Stone a static shock, who growls in return. They then talk about gossip, Laslo’s death and about a puppy causing the cold storms. Aia asks the party of their next goal. They decide that checking up on Nogmire is the most pressing followed up by getting the curse removed. They approach the hospice, is stands there, a building not unlike others. No Nogmire, however there is a well dressed lady, who is dressed very fine, waring something akin to a doctors clothes, seemingly teaching another woman. Grim asks them if they need any help. The woman approaches him, her eyes two different colours reddish brown and bluish gray. Alistina walks outside mistaking a coat in the shadow for Nogmire, Stone follows making sure she’s fine in the head. Grimm gets to know the woman a bit, Glovia Faline. They talk a bit until Grimm says his goodbyes and leaves. The party goes to the hair and hare to buy some stuff, they see a new man along with the usual shopkeep, seemingly bartering some jewelry. Stone walks to Gregorius and asks for 5 arrows, which he then buys. The big guy exits brushing past Trent, who notices that he’s colder than a normal person should be. Gregorious inquires if the party would like to retrieve the lycanthrope body that they left in his basement. Stone hands him a gold for his troubles. As they leave Trent sees the man disappear in the distance. They follow hit tracks up north, which somehow disappear in the snow as they find the man’s hat. Trent kicks it up a tree and climbs up to get it. The party, not finding any tracks go south to where Nogmire should be. They travel for a couple of hours until they come across a scene, a cart on the side of the road and a slumped figure resting against a wall. Stone dashes up to it, recognizing it as a unconscious Nogmire, he also sees three harpies behind the cart and a dead body by them. Stone fires an arrow at a harpy and hides behind a rock.
Roll for initiative
The harpy flies up to Stone slashing and smashing into him. Another harpy plays an alluring tune, charming Grimm and Alis. But not before grimm manages to miss a guiding bolt. Stone flees from the one who attacked him. A harpy attacks grimm and another Alistina as trent goes in for an ankle smash on one of them. Stone slashes at the same one sees Alistina fires a burst of flame at one and as she flees, she gets attacked and downed. Stone gets downed right after. Trent goes in for the ankles again and gives Stone a word of healing, after grimm healed Alis. Stone, in a burst of energy, slashes at the harpy who downed him, first with his shortsword making a big gash in its side, then pokes it with his silver dagger, then straining his  muscles slashes again with his shortsword cleaving it dead. A harpy tries to run and as it does so, grim smashes another harpy to the ground, killing it. They all run to the fleeing harpie ending it off. Grimm goes over to Nogmire, trying to wake him, shakes him tells him to wake, says that people are escaping with the taxes. Nogmire seems to be alive, yet decaying slowly in his armor. Alistina’s healing earlier seems to have helped him. They look at the caravan and see the dead bodys get up and start attacking them. They’re quickly taken care of. Grimm and Trent get the cart upright and put the stuff and Nogmire into the cart. The Elements of surprise start heading back into town. They go to the hospice and takes Nogmire to the lady who inspects him. She tells them of an undead in the area. Stone puts the two and two together and thinks that the undead that was in the Hair and Hare who was bartering goods might’ve gotten them from robbing the caravan. Then there enters a man and asks if this is Nogmire’s companions, they say yes and he leads them to the Burgomaster’s. As they approach the man gives a speech of how the party is not suspected of anything and the people around start to murmur. They enter the house. The inside of the house is clearly that of a wealthy individual. A woman beckons them to sit and a man on the side is serious, identified as Burgomaster. He introduces himself and the woman as Sybil Rasia a person with sight. She had divined things about the party like an army of dead, a doll and an attractive woman. The party remarks on how the divination was accurate and Burgomaster gets displeased at the information. She then offers the party a more in depth divination.  They then are asked to link hands, clear their heads and close their eyes. The world seems to drift as a warmth flushes over and images of objects float in to view. They see what seems to be a large manor’s house the party seems to be warming some sort of formal attire, still seeming spectral.Only a gentle plucking of a harpsichord is heard from a girl playing it until there’s a scream, that of a man, there under the sweet smell is a faint smell of rot, the same that was on the hat. There are paintings on the wall and some dolls in the room. Alis takes a look at the dolls and find a clock work one with the letters L.F(Lucien Feline). Stone looks at the paintings and sees Glovia and the child playing the harpsichord, probably her child. Grimm finds an open book in which is written, that Glovia grieves for the child Isabelle who died cause of her failings. She killed Lucien, is researching a way to get her child back, she is not sorry for what happened to the Vistani girl(Lela), her experiments with Laslo seems a success, she feels Laslo will betray her. She also found someone who would help her, she needs a doll, Glovia doesn’t care for the reason why. The child playing the harpsichord is disease ridden and rotting. Trent sees this and is mortified. Alis goes over to some drink, the girl tells her it’s good for her. Alis drinks it and feels refreshed. The same scream as before echoes in the house. Alis asks the girl what that was, she answers that it’s daddy being fixed. Grim goes to Alis and talks of the journal and its contents. Isabella walks over to the table that had the glasses Alistina picked up, and picked up a box, telling Alis that the pretty lady wants it. She opens the box and sees a simple doll, like made by a child, a girls with its dress on, as it comes into focus for Alis the glass implodes on all the windows as a figure comes crashing through, a wispy creature Laslo flies in grabbing the box and chapping off the girls head with a large axe. The party then wakes up. The village is under attack.
Laslo is holding a torch outside and throws a torch onto a building setting it on fire. He yells about how Glovia now needs to betray the village like she was going to betray him. The party sees a pack of skeletons going from building to building setting them on fire. A storage is ablaze that holds food storages of the winter, a leading undead is seen, a prisoner pleading help is seen in the burning prison, promising it to be made worth it. Grimm heads towards the zombies closing in on villagers. Grimm pulls out his holy symbol and tries to turn undead, to make them flee. Stone runs to the jail, trying to open the lock, he doesn’t make it in time as the roof collapses. Trent runs to the skeletons and smashes them into pieces. Alistina goes to the flames to try to save the supplies. Grimm fights the zombies he takes them down, one by one, getting hit only a few times.  Grimm gets extremely exhausted flailing at them he finally lands the ending blow on the last one breathing heavily. Stone tries to pick the lock again as the burning roof falls on the man, stone bolts out of  there. Trent thinks of how to extinguish the flames on the house and decides it’s a lost cause. He goes inside to hurry the people out and helps them carry the valuables, suddenly the roof collapses, but not before Trent manages to save the man inside. Alistina, trying to extinguish the flames, the roof falls towards Alis burning, she extinguishes it out of reflex and gets hit by the falling debris, trapping her in place. She tries to burn the beam above her to escape though she fails in doing so. Grim heads over to the large undead, the one giving orders. Alistina frees herself and they all meet up in the middle of getting to the big undead.
Roll for Initiative
Stone fires an arrow at the ghoul missing, trent throws a hammer at it. As the undead gets close Alis emolts it and heals Trent and Grimm at the same time. It being pissed off rips into her paralysing and nearly downing her. Stone dashes in and slashes at the ghoul ending it. A ring drops from it, a status ring from the Feline family. The party is rewarded for their efforts. A woman appears hysterical. Her child was taken to the manor and her husband followed trying to save the kid.

Dear Diary, session 15


The party heads towards the Falin manor seeing it fallen into dilapidation from neglect. They see an ominous castle in the distance. They approach the front door and grim opens it. Stone sees the floor inside as being brittle and unsafe, he turns around and hands everyone a part of his rope. He steps inside carefully going to the nearest door, he opens it and sees Isabella with her ghostly form and mangled body. He is surprised and then asks the ghost if they’d had any visitors. she floats through a wall and stone looks through another door seeing her hanging by a noose he is horrifyed. As this happened trent falls through the floor luckily the rope catches him and alistina pulls him up with the strength of several men. Stone opens a window for Grimm to enter through. They see the ghost float through a wall south, they follow through a door, they find an axed room the same one they were in before in their ethereal form. Isabella says she’ll introduse them to her friends. The party goes to the balcony, finding herbs and windows on the sides. they go back inside and go through a door, they see Isabella, she’s shocked and says that only mom is allowed inside. Trent asks stone to pick the door once he’s tried to kick it open. Stone looks at the door and sees that the door can be opened with a ring. The same one the ghoul in the toun had. He unlocks the door and they step inside. They see isabelle talking with some wax skinned children,  their chests carved empty and gaping. As they see the party, their teeth start clattering and they run up striking.
Roll for initiative
The wax kind of dolls are easily taken care of except for Alis getting hit. In the meantime Isabella is dancing to a non existent song and floats out the west side. after destroying the wax children the party goes west. They enter through a door into a once garden, with plants withered and overgrown. There also is a pool of putrid blood and body parts. to the north there is a crumpled staircase. As stone looks at the staircase a bloody tendril reaches out of the pool and strikes at Stone.
Roll for initiative
Stone scuttles up the wall as a piercing screech is heard from the Gibbering Mouther. The mouther follows up the wall and is struck by trent. Stone then drops next to it and strikes it and is downed by it the instant after. Trent moves closer and heals Stone. Grimm slowly approaches, Stone slashes at it. And as Alis burns it it screeches out in many different languages. Including glovia screaming “Laslo get out!” Stone is horrified. Alis and Trent are paralyzed in fear. While waiting for them to return to normal, Stone climbs up where the stairs used to be, he hears two voices. A whimpering of a puppy is heard and with a thump it stops. Stone climbs down and breaks the news to the others. They move one and enter a room with a table with covers, it has a covered dish. That shutters as we approach. As Alis and Grimm use a ten foot pole to knock the cover off. A ghost goose flies out squacking and Isabella soon appears and grapples the ghost. They find a smoking room filled with fake weapons and two real daggers. They also come across a library in a much better condition than the rest of the house. There’s a table with a tea set with seven cups. There’s a teapot with some green tea. After drinking they feel rejuvenated, they go up the stairs in the library, seeing some toys and larger mechanical creations Lucien’s workshop most likely. They take a look at some of the creations. Stone takes a step through a door and stepps in ghost droppings. They present stone a box with a keyhole, he answers that while the box does not open it seems to be activated by a key. Stone steps back, falls and knocks himself unconscious. The rest of a party find notes on what this box is and how it’s controlled. It’s a box that controls all the mechanical creations. It’s code is up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a. Stone wakes up and puts the box in his bag. They exit the room to a corridor, Isabelle is eager to show them her room. Stone doesn’t want to as he's grown annoyed at the ghost. Trent opens the door and sees a surprisingly well kept room, Isabella is excited and dancing around the room filled with toys. She goes south through a wall inviting the others to see her favourite toy. As they do so they see many puppets marionetting an unconscious man to dance. Alis tells her to let him go, she starts crying and floats away. The toy soldiers start attacking.
Roll for initiative
They swarm on stone and Grimm and after Stone and Trent go down and are brought up the combat finishes with Alistina sparing one of the toy soldiers because she got attached. Stone makes sure the man is fine. They fortify the door and have a rest. After the rest the party decides to use the box, the mechanical soldier Alis saved gets up and salutes Grim. A knocking is heard from the door. Two toy soldiers enter once Grimm opens the door and they salute him. Stone goes and scouts on ahead. He comes across a room filled with body parts stitched to mechanical bits. Stone finds a potion of climbing and looking through a keyhole she see Glovia chanting and performing a ritual. He goes to the window after taking a potion of climbing. He sees glovia and the unconscious body of Sabrina marked in runes, alongside the dead body of Isabella and a flesh golem holding a ritual book for her. Stone tells the party of this and they make a plan to rush in when Stone breaks the window to surprise Glovia, and attacks her twice slashing at her. In the same moment Grimm breaks down a door rushing in with the toy soldiers and Trent does the same Glovia reaches out to stone with her hand radiating necrotic energy. It almost touches his face but by a fluke of luck it misses only taking a ton of fur along with it (It would have instant killed Stone but amber saved him with a dm inspiration). She then rushes out of the door and throws a fire bomb and hits almost everyone in the room. Stone then rushes after har and Alistina heals Stone and burns her with a spell. Trent then banes her and then she rushes to the next room over, stone follows and slashes at her, and moves out of her range. She follows after and slashes twice at stone, downing him. Alis rushes after blocking the door with fire. Trent rushes by throwing a guiding bolt at Glovia, glovia puts up a shield blocking it. She then teleports out of there and shocks Trent, and runs away towards another room. The golem runs up to Trent and downs him.  the battle continues for a long time, Alistina casting fire spells, Grimm controlling the toy soldiers.
Stone dies bleeding out in the back room. He spends his last moments thinking of his companions and of how this has been the most enjoyable time of his life, travelling and having fun with them.
Alistina heals Trent, getting him back up Trent in retribution hits the Golem with all his might stunning him. They finally take down the golem and now fixate on Glovia. Trent finally finishes her off, screaming about a sacrifice to Vulkur and throws a light hammer with full force smashing through her head. They rush to the now dead and curled up stone.
Stine floats above the party floating up into the beastlands, between the flecks of emotion, there is a particular warm feeling in his chest that of companionship. As Grimm feels a warmth in his pocket a particular warmth, not that of alcohol, heat, pride, he reaches into his pocket. A coin that Blasseios gave him, Grimm twirls it around his fingers, he almost sees a hand outstretched towards him, Grimm throws the coin, the spectral hand catching it disappearing. A warm hand grabs him, softly like a mother pulling him back into his body now warming up and opening his eyes to see the tears of Alistina falling onto his bloodied fur, and Grimm standing there sadly. He reaches out a hand and pulls Alis and then Grim close in an embrace. The last toy soldier salutes Grimm and gets one back. As they sit there in and embrace they hear “I’m glad you got your friend back” from Isabelle in the corner, as she slowly starts fading, smiling. They find the place where Glovia sleeps, there is a chest with money, a scroll of Revivify and a Tome of skills. They exit the house with the unconcious girl. There is a mob outside, after dealing with the undead in the town. A man in the crowd yells “Who are you?”. Stone cracks his paws and says back “Well… The Elements of Surprise”. They receive cheers as the town folks praise them and the manor is set on fire. The toy soldier follows the party to the bounds of the house, then it deactivates. They grab the four now deactivated toy soldiers, three of them broken. Grimm heads over to where Nogmire sees him resting peacefully. Stone and Alis have creeping bestial dreams as their hair and fur grows, and nails extend, Stone finding that he can no longer retract his claws.

Dear Diary, session 16


The day starts with the party returning downstairs, Alis and Stone seeming more turned towards the lycanthrope nature. They get a few stares as they sit down to eat. Trent hears a few rumors, the towns people being general sheeple. Grimm tells the party that they should go and check up on Nogmire before going to the pretty lady. And finally get the body from the Hair and Hare and burn it. As they exit the inn they smell burning flesh. As the bodies from yesterday are being burned. Trent gets on his knees, praying to Vulkur for guidance on the weather. Not seeing any sign they continue to the hospice to check up on Nogmire. As they enter they see they see the man and his daughter, who they saved from the manor. He shakes their hands energetically thanking them all. Grimm sees Nogmire, in a side room a sheet covering half his body, he approaches and sees he’s alive though nowhere near healed. They have a small discourse. Grimm casting a spell to identify what’s wrong with Nogmire, he finds a blight, seemingly non magical in nature. Afra mother of the girl tells Alis a bit about Glovia and her child Isabella and that she had an illness a few years before she died. Meanwhile Alis is making sure Nogmire is comfortable. Grimm takes a few extra minutes to identify a green vial, and it is identified it as alchemist’s fire. Stone looks through the potions, bottles, and such to find anything and does not. The party get close to the  the Hair and Hare, and see the door barred with wood, from which they duck under. Gregorious, is angry at the party for taking so long, especially since the corpse came back to undeath, and he had to smash it’s head in. Trent goes over and grabs the body, they drag it to where the the other bodies are being burned. They set it on the funeral pyre and lights it on fire. As they set off towards it is somewhere near midday but the fog rolling over the mountains makes it hard to see. They walk up north deeper into the forest towards where the house should be. They spot a white sack of web with a beak pointing out from under it with dark feathers. As they approach, trent sees dragmarks near the webbed figure. Alistina creates a bonfire to heal the bird and burn away the webbing. Stone moves closer and recognizes the bird as a kenku. The party hears skittering all around them. As Alis is comforting the kenku an ettercap appears
Roll initiative
Stone fires an arrow with his quick senses. It scuttles closer and fires web at the party, who dodge, and then it bites Stone. Grimm runs in close but misses with his attack. The ettercap bites Grimm and slashes at Stone, downing him. The kenku tries to hide as Alistina burns the ettercap and gets Stone. Stone runs behind the spider like creature and shoves his shortsword deep into it, killing it.
They converse with the kenku, finding out that his flock is east and most likely in as much trouble as he was in. The bird knows the pretty lady. The party decides to help his flock and go east. Stone asks the bird of his name and gets to know it’s  a whistle sound. They continue onwards into the forest and and see a large webbed orb twenty feet across. They see kenkus locked in the webbing.
Roll for initiative
Alis tries to stealth, covering her lantern. Though Ulgrimm tries the same though he is loud. Stone stealthily goes into the shadows pulling out her bow. Alis sees a swarm of spiders on the big web orb. Grimm throws a rock, trying to distract the spiders. They move closer a bit. An ettercap sprouts out from inside. It scatters towards Grimm and slashes into him, the swarms of spiders move closer to Grimm. The dwarf then tries to strike the ettercap and hits. Stone fires an arrow at the ettercap, though it misses. Trent burns a swarm of spiders with lightning as the ettercap strikes at  Grimm though it misses. Alistina fires a bolt of fire at the ettercap. As the fire spreads over to the nearby webs Grimm ends the ettercap. The kenku runs over to his friend and cuts him loose from the webbing dragging his unconscious friend. Stone follows and cuts another free. The fire spreads further and they get more birds free. As stone tries to free one, he sees it’s a human, and as he cuts the webbing, a hoard of spiders fall out onto him. Grimm pulls a kenku loose and stone flees from the hoard of spiders, to a kenku cutting him loose. All of the kenkus are alive, though most are unconscious. The awake birds talk Sylvan. As they wake up Stone gives two of them cloaks and and tries to talk to them, they express gratitude to the party. Alistina finds a strange scroll containing a poem.
“Birdie with a redcap,
    His sword is long and keen,
    If he sees you sing and clap,
    And make that birdie scream.
    Defence”
    Grimm tries to remember anything about this but remembers nothing. Stone introduces the party and talks to the kenkus. The party then sets off towards the pretty lady. They follow a trail leading to a grove. Seeing small humanoid shapes forest creatures with black eyes. Trent goes first, walking towards the creatures, pulling out his warhammer, trying to threaten them away, they fade to the forest. The party continues onward towards their destination, hoping they won’t return. As they’re walking forward they hear a crunch as Trent steps on a bit of loose earth.
    Roll for initiative
    A sapling suddenly gets up and strikes at Trent grappling him. And vines sprout out from the ground restraining Stone and Alis. Another one pops up, Alistina burns two of the now three vine blights. Trent was downed. Alistina emolts one with a bonfire. Grimm hits one and heals Trent. Alistina burns another one and the last vine blight is dealt with by Trent as he smashes its head off. Black sap splashes onto Grimm and Stone. Grimm helps Alistina free.
    They continue on their way, they find a small cottage, clearly lived in, with a cooking pot outside above a fire, and a moss covered roof. They continue closer, and hear a snap of bone and a beastial shreak, and see a dead ghoulish man slumped up against a tree. They see a vistani woman with green hair brandishing a broom rage on her face. She is unnaturally pretty and asks the party inside for some food. As they enter inside they see a flaming skull that repeats that he’s Brandy. They enter the small house. She inquires the party of the reason for them being there. Stone answers that there are two reasons and asks the woman if she knows of lycanthropy.         She answers she knows many things and inspects Alis’ hands.  She can remove the lycanthropy if they deal with a problem she has. They have to deal with Laslo who has something of her’s and must kill him and get it back. Stone asks the woman if controlling lycanthropy is possible, and she answers that it’s a fool’s errand. Grimm asks her of what’s going on with Sir Nogmire and she answers that it’s Laslo’s undeath spreading to those he attacks and that killing Laslo would solve it. The pretty woman talks to each of them about their wants. Grimm asks the pretty woman if she could give him the ability to understand magic better, she agrees and he pricks his finger after being asked to and ages visibly before their eyes, he ages 100 years, his beard shooting out being the only visible difference. Trent trades his ability to see his family for embodying Vulkur more. The party heads to rest. They have weird dreams peculiar and strange. In the night, when Trent goes to take a leak, he opens the door and is blinded by light only to see a strange place full of light. He takes his leak and gets back inside. In the morning Brandy floats inside waking them all and talking about a dead undead outside and something about the bell. They walk outside and find a bell. They try to avoid the bell but it reappears. They walk through the bell and nothing unexpected happens. They come across a clearing filled with corpses of various kinds. In the middle is a large undead, crunching on some bone. They prepare to attack it when Alice hears a deep voice like Erheart, the wisp, but deeper. It asks why the party is here. After a line of questions, Laslo reveals that he’s here because Glovia asked him to get this thing he holds out, a doll trinket covered with blood. Laslo is glad that Glovia is dead, and is feasting on these bodies. Stone draws his bow, and lets loose an arrow towards the undead, missing, and Grimm follows up with a guiding bolt.
    Roll for initiative
    Grimm then in a burst of speed follows up with another guiding bolt burning the undead once more. Trent, seeing how effective this is he follows suit, burning him once more. Laslo, drawing his longsword, he holds it oddly, like a bow, he holds it oddly, firing two bolts of necrotic energy, barely missing Grim and Trent. Alis misses with a fire bolt and Stone fires an arrow into him. As trent runs towards Laslo he runs past two bodies, who lash up at him, one hitting. He pulls up his holy symbol and turns undead. Laslo and the shadows start running away as far as possible. Stone runs towards Laslo, firing an arrow at him but missing. Grimm trudges closer and sacred flames laslo scorching him slightly. Trent throws a guiding bolt at him but misses the undead. Stone misses another arrow and Grimm runs up throwing another guiding bolts a massive burst of divine energy blowing a hole in its chest. They pull the body back from the forest, and search through. They take the trinket. They return to the pretty lady, also known as Jenny. They hand the doll back to her, Grimm identifies this doll as one that is over 200 years old, one covered with blood of near the same age. She invites them in. Grimm asks the lady about the bell, while talking she pulls out one nail from Alis and then Stone. She then does some strange ritual with it and asks the two to lie down. She mounts Stone and slashes his chest creating a large gash at which he yelps out in pain. She enters the fingernail under his skin and the wound heals as Stone starts convulsing. The lady then approaches Alistina and pushes her down on a chair and repeats the ritual on her.  All of their body hair, teeth and nails are falling out growing and regrowing several times. Stone chokes on his teeth and gets heimliched by Grimm and Trent. When Alice wakes up she remembered her time in the Fey wilds, and her eyes look like they’re solid gold glowing brighter and brighter she has now gained strange wings and she’s flying a few feet off the ground. As Stone tries to get up he gets extremely dizzy his head banging, like the worst hangover he’s ever had, he crawls over to his bag and drinks the rest of his bottle of blerry. The pretty woman goes over to Alis,  and tells her, if she ever were to need help to just call her. Good luck getting out of the house of pines and beware the vampires she says to the party. They return to town. Nogmire is fine and got his tax. Alistina turns out to be an Aasimar.
    ________________
    Dear Diary, session 17
    It’s early evening when the party is travelling in the carriage up north, around half a day. They talk some of what happened in the town they just left. Of the lycanthropy now gone, of what transpired in the manor, and a bit about Alis and her newfound Aasimar Hood. They ride onwards on their carriage, thinking chatting and discussing.  Trent seems to be a bit regretful of what he traded with the pretty lady. As night approaches they come to a stop at a small town, and they go to a tavern. At night Alis sees a blinding light as her angelic guide appears, she tells her a cryptic message: ”A horror birthed in flame, the dimming light of hope, a rival and friend for the ages, a storm of sorrow twisted by frost made flesh, protect what you can for one day your flame will banish the midnight chill.”. The party awakens the next day.
    Stone spends a week training with Nogmire, practicing the art of feints and slashes, getting in close and maneuvering through the guard and getting back out. At the end of the workweek Stone feels clear improvements. Alis spends the week trying to better herself though she is quite distracted, at the end of it she feels a bit better. Trent spends his week hunting and gathering prey, he finds a crippled animal and takes pity, healing it removing it’s toxins. Grimm spends his week as he usually does, in a forge, he also tests out his newly found power conjuring a floating warhammer.
    Nogmire thanks the party and and they celebrate all the party has done so far, and they drunk and party. Nogmire tells the party of his ambition, to eventually retire and join the crown’s guard.
    After two months of travel and collecting taxes. They have a tenday to do whatever and Alistina uses it to read a tome and study to be more knowledgeable about arcana, she reads it, the words changing but after a week of study the pages flick to the end and sees “To my dearest Ashley of Camonrock, may this guide you on your quest for knowledge. - Dreali Amakia of the Sagecoast” and Alis becomes smarter. One day it’s Alistina’s birthday and Stone gifts her a bathing oil. As stone is driving down the street, a man comes barreling towards him, on a goat. As they approach they get bigger and bigger and they turn out to be giant goats. Stone deftly avoids them turning the cart. Stone is sitting in a tree on the outskirts of town, as he hears a landshark looking thing shoot out of the ground, chomping the bird and disappearing under the ground again. The party sets onto a clearing and Nogmire says that this is the place. He tells the party to unload the tax here, they’ve about an hour. Stone looks over to Grimm and bets three gold pieces that a dragon is going to show up to carry it away. He agrees thinking that it’ll never happen. Lo and behold, a gold dragon appears with the thunderous sound of its wings booming. Nogmire converses with it in draconic. They unload the taxes and Alis compliments the dragon who thanks the party for its help overbearingly. Trent asks the dragon about if it know of any dragons can breathe fire or control the weather, Alis goes and tries to pull trent away. The dragon tells him of three, blue dragons, bronze dragons and one’s who have thrown away his dragon heritage. Suddenly the dragon raises his wings and a whirlwind picks up as the dragon starts lifting off. The travelling continues.
    Four months from them ending Laslo the party is in an inn, they see a half orc enter, with a letter for Sir Nogmire. The half orc eyes the party and they introduce themselves he’s called Howard. Howard is a warrior and a cobbler. They are heading to Anton. Grimm heads to the smithy and meets Goron another dwarf, who lets him freely use the forge. He spends the whole tenday smithing in a blur. As he wakes on the 11th day he sees a perfect set of dwarven plate armor. On the chest area is a symbol of Moradin and his initials under it.
    ________________
    Dear Diary, session 18
    Alis's birthday drinking gets interrupted by Nogmire who apologizes but says that we must go.
    We grab our stuff, and head out to the cart, on the way to wherever we are going, Nogmire tells us that a Tax Collector has gone Rogue, and apparently it is an old friend of his, they fought together in a war 10 years or so ago.
    He mentions that Bithwick always had a thing for the bottle, and all that came with it, so that might be a reason for him "going rogue".


    We arrive at the village of Phalan early in the evening the wooden palisade wall stands around the entire town, the gates are wide open, no guards around, no people to be seen or heard.
    We stop with the carriage outside, and Stone slips into the shadows and has a look around, after finding a lot of blood and drag marks he makes his way back to the party, and they all head on in, weapons at the ready.
    Howard inspects the house the blood/drag marks came from, he deducts that the attacks were made with a Longsword, and very quick slashes at that, he finds some gold stashed away in a pouch which leads him to believe that this Rogue collector isn't actually after the money. he also wants to take it, but Nogmire says we're not Raiders, we're Tax Collectors.


    We follow the trail, come upon an Inn, more bloodsplatter, some innards on the floor.
    Grim finds weapons on the floor, but doesn't look like they even had a chance to strike back.
    Alis and Grim heads to the backroom, figures this happened 12-16 hours ago, since the Stew has been on for about that time.
    Trent and Howard look into the rooms upstairs, they find more blood, and two big bags of Tax Money.


    They keep following the trail until they come to the town's square, a literal wall of bodies have been stacked there, and once they maneuver around it, they can see a naked man sitting in the middle, covered in blood, holding a sword and some sort of small bundle.
    There's blood everywhere and some other liquid mixed in.
    Nogmire is in shock, as he sees Bithwick sitting there.
    Bitvik keeps mumbling nonsense, something about "the king", and after a little bit he looks up in the night sky and proclaims that "He's here" (he has a raging boner at this point)
    Trent tries to command him to kneel, but Bithwick does not, "combat" ensues as Trent summons a spiritual weapon and hits him, then moves up to strike him with the Warhammer, Stone Fires an arrow at the man, Nogmire is frozen in shock, Alis takes aim and shoots off three rays of fire.
    They back off, but as they do almost all of them get gripped by fear in one way or another.
    Some fall unconscious at the spot, some get paralyzed, and some just don't know what to do and look to others for what they should do.
    Everyone gets out in the end and go up on a hill, Trent sees someone watching them, through the flames as they leave.
    Looking down from the hill they can see the fire burning and the wall of corpses form a symbol that is now burning brightly, Grim and Trent go insane and run off mumbling and muttering.
    They get dealt with after a while, everyone somehow manages to sleep.
    The next day the village is pretty much gone, nothing is left.
    They find a smooth quartz sphere with the same symbol on it, Grim tries to identify it, but it's as if he just hears/sees static.
    They leave ---> Time Skip.

After approaching the tower and investigating, they find it to be cloud giant made. Howard knocks on the door. The door opens, there is another door behind it. they enter and a cloud giant appears behind a force barrier. He asks the party of why they’re here. They answer that they were curious of the tower and just arrived here. The great wizard Zepherus is clearly insane. He’s also got a gryphon, who recently returned from a hunt.

    Sone goes to the manor, he goes around the back to the Fenix manor going through the gate, entering the garden. Seeing no guards watching he climbs to the second floor. He enters through the balcony. He looks around for  a while staying out of sight. He does not find the document on this floor so he decides to climb up further. He is nearly seen by a guard but is saved by a stone falling from the sky distracting him. Stone climbs up and sees what he’s looking for. He takes the scroll and carefully retreats, not boing spotted. He goes to the retrieval spot and places the parchment there. He takes a look at the sealed parchment without opening it but all he can tell is that it is a report from a border.
    They convince Nogmire to go to Perron, on the travels that once see big black smoke beyond the treeline and decide to investigate. Nogmire whips the horses making them running towards the smoke. They jump out of the caravan at the sight of a burning tavern. The fire morphs and sneers in the form of a face. Nogmire knocks down the embered door. They all rush inside. A burst of fire knocks almost everyone down. They see a humanoid shaped fire elemental and people trapped by a rubble.
    Roll initiative
    Stone dashes to the elemental slashing past him as as bolt of fire hits Alis. Grimm guiding bolds it with the fire elemental. Stone slashes the elemental and goes to the rubble pulling out an unconscious man and his panicking son using a crowbar to pry the boards. The fighter and clerics take care of the elemental with Nogmire. Stone heads to the back. He tries to pry another person free after grim points him out. This one seems a bit more hard with a beam from the roof holding the person in place. Stone asks Grimm for help. He goes to help the others fight the elemental. Grimm manages to leverage the man free as Alis is calming the people outside. As the Elemental strikes Trent one last time a burst of thunder strikes it, ending its life force.
    After a sizeable bit of travel the party arrives at Perron. Entering through a giant gate, clearly Dwarven in origin. As the party enters they are put through customs for magic and magic items. They have to compile a list of the magic items they have and their magic casters. They get told only cantrips that are utility are allowed. Almost never allowed to cast spells above lvl 3.

    Dear Diary, session 20
Half orc zhentarim leads stone to a back room with Sir Davil Starsong in it, most likely high elf. Stone and he talk and he asks (Port town of of Kith)
    Thief mission, a package of interest needs interest.  A job was done, but no payment was given. A safe needs picking, most likely trapped. watch out for traps, particularly high hanging tripwires. He also points Stone to the general direction.
    front and side entrance, side entrance. picks side entrance door, seckond lock inside. Front door is easier, picks it and notices a silver strand midair, high enough to not bother a gnome. He sneaks past it into the back room. He looks for the safe and does not initially find it. He bumps into a toy, setting it off. As the toy makes noise and jumps around, Stone hears footsteps approach. He stands still besides the door, hoping it’s opening would cover his body. The gnome enters and just as he notices Stone, the dull side of Stone’s short sword strikes his neck knocking him unconscious. Stone then proceeds to find the safe and retrieve what seems to be drugs from it. He tucks the Gnome in his bed and leaves. He leaves the package at the drop point and goes back to the Yawning Portal.
    grimm does smith think and sell thing
    Alis sold her woven clothes and asks about Aasimar things at the cathedral. She also visits the Mages and Protectorates and the library. She looks for information about the Mages and Protectorates. She asks a bust information and gets directions to a shelf. A pink robed man helps her when she’s lost. She finds out stuff about it. The headquarters is held in a pocket plane. Information about their leader has been partly redacted. She also finds information about them being blamed for just about every bad thing that happens.
    Howard arm wrestles the half orc and yeets a child into a garbage can.
    Trent spends his time in the Yawning portal, trying to find out information about the north. His endeavors are not as successful as he’d hoped. He finds out some information about the people and local. He finds out information about a dragon.

    Dear Diary, session 21
    The session starts with trent talking to the people and finding more stuff about the northerners, raiders also known as freyans. They like to raid the northern parts of Cynnabrim. Trent decides to find the white dragon, kill some raiders. The half-orc invites him to arm wrestle. He then sets off to the cathedral of saint Dagta. He looks around and takes in the scenery. He sees some elves, he’s not seen this kind. They seem to be arguing, after asking them, Trent finds out that they don’t work here. They’re complaining that they aren’t allowed to see the bright one. After entering the cleric is lead to a meditation chamber. He runs into Sir Nogmire. He claims to be here to pray to the seven and frowns when Trent asks if he knows who the bright one is. Trent leaves and notices Nogmire holding a prayer book. The cleric then proceeds into the room with a single shrine, without signifying features. He sits in contemplation.
    In the evening the party meets up in the Yawning Portal, They get some drinks and have a short chat. They then go to bed, Stone gets 25gp from the Zhentarim. In the morning they meet with Sir Nogmire and head into the carriage and start heading off into the distance. It’s been a few days, Stone is leading the cart. While driving he sees a figure on the road, bare feet, slightly ragged. He extends his hand and Stone slows the cart to a stop. he looks behind him at Nogmire, informing him there seems to be someone who wants to travel. Nogmire lets Stone decide and the tabaxi extends a hand to the drow, helping him up. They exchange polite conversation and stone introduces Naal to the party. The robed tallish and really polite drow is going to Kith for business reasons. They travel for three days more. Talking sometimes, Naal not eating anything but seeming fine. His business is looking for Eira.
    While traveling the carriage get’s ambushed by a Pack of gnolls. The party takes care of them with assistance from Naal. They clear out the path and continues on the path.
    Stone drives the tax mobile down the road by a river, with the rest of the party chatting and Nogmire sleeping. Trent asks Naal why he pat a gnoll on the head, who responds he’s never seen an undead before. As they’re riding along they hear distant thumping which grows closer. They see a large fat looking giant lumbering with an alive cow. He runs on ahead of the caravan and picks up a fallen tree hurtling it towards the party. Stone, with his quick reflexes drifts the cart mostly out of the way, removing the brunt of the damage.
    Roll for initiative
    Nogmire flies at the giant and cleaves into him as Naal creates a ball of darkness centered on his head. The others slash and attack it’s feet, being the only visible part of it, The giant then then runs out of the darkness swinging at air confused.  Howard takes a massive swing into the giant, making it buckle under the swing. A fish flies out of the giant smacking Stone in the face. They end the giant with a bolt of lightning. They hear a bunch of people rushing over in the distance. Trent takes the javelin of lightning from the giants head and presents it towards the people as Howard frees the cow. The folk introduce themselves as Rindawans. They’ve been chasing the giant after it attacked their village. They invited the party to feast with them, they find out similarities between them and Trent. They find out the lightning javelin is called The Will of Vulkur. Turns out that Trent’s root’s might stretch to this tribe. A hill giant frenzie has whipped up a greed amongst the hill giants. This making the people suffer. The party comes to a war camp, where people are being tended to and rest in. they asked for help in saving a princess in the giant stronghold. The party considers this.

    Dear Diary, session 21
    The elements of surprise have devised a plan to get into the fortress, it damming the local river. One side being covered by water. They are told a bit about the place, there being many types of beings, goblinoids, giants and others. The plan of attack is going to be sneaking inside. Stone and Trent go to scout the area, they find the optimal path to get to the stronghold without being noticed. Grimm takes a look at the warbands equipment, Alsitina pats a bee. The elements of surprise don cloacks covered in mud to be more sneaky.
    They set off in the evening covered in the shadows of night a brigade of bugbears attack. One notices the party and alarms the others
    Roll for initiative
    Stone flies into the frey slashing into the front leader, ducking behind cover. The battle ensues, flanking howard howard striking back. Alsitina emolts some and another flanks her. Stone flies behind the flaker, freeing her. Trent and Grimm constantly miss their attacks against a single bugbear. Stone flies around the battlefield behind their enemies. Eventually they whittle down their enemies. Grimm finally landing a blow, ending the last one.
    They decide to take a break, letting some people rest, the dwarf casts a spell to divine if climbing the wall is a good idea, he decides that it is. They approach and climb up, they slink along the wall, scouting the area they see the shadow of a giant coming out of the doorway. They discuss quietly what to do, Trent casts fog cloud throwing the giant into a cloud of smoke as they sneak past. The party enters the room and sees two curtains. Alis marks how one has big tracks leading to it and the other has small tracks. As Stone peeks behind the smaller curtain he sees orcs sitting down and playing cards.




    After falling down the party frees some more tribe members and fights a two headed etin.  A large scale combat. There they fight a number of creatures, not the least of their worries being Videl, who starts force choking Grimm for his rock. A newly rescued tribal princess rages taking out many of the goblins and with the party’s help the two headed etin. A large and fat giant comes clambering down heaving rocks all over the place. one of the rocks takes out the princess. The party manage to end the giant, but not before stone goes down.


    Dear Diary, session 22
    Grimm says words of healing and get’s stone up. He then rushes over to the princess and uses a scroll of revivafy to revive her. The party then runs upwards to save more tribesmen. as they do so they see gnolls coming from the east. as the clerics take care of them Stone and Lagatha(the princess) free the captives. As the captives are being freed a swarm of goblins rush in from the south-west but most are quickly dealt with by Alsitinas burning hands. The rest are dealt with by Stone and Trent. Alis sees a pig she really wants and tries to get it, even though the fortress is on high alert. Seeing that, Trent goes and tries to grab though it escapes. Stone runs with uneery speed to the front of the party leading Lagatha to an exit they saw earlier. as they run towards it they spot a gnoll warband. They start attacking the band which attacks back, Lagatha’s defences magically heightened by Grimm. They manage to kill everyone eventually, but not without casualties of the captives sacrificed themselves. The party then exits the cave and with a thump a large fat giant comes falling next to them, though they have a few seconds to react, they see a star in the sky getting bigger and bigger, Videl’s doing. And in a few seconds the dam bursts open and water gushes out, most manage to get to shore fairly quickly. Except for stone who gets pulled along with the currents for 27 miles. Grimm and Trent with their heavy armor manage to stay still and help some people out of the water. The party tries to look for Stone for a long time, they find a lot of things, giant sized sandals, ring that changes size and Stone found two gems in the eyes of a small statue. Stone set up camp where he washed ashore, lighting a fire he rests and so do the rest Lagatha offers a toast to The Elements of Surprise, naming Trent a Son of Vulkar. As people party, stone seit’s alone and drinks fire wine, wet and exhausted, next to a makeshift fire. In the morning stone notices a town in the distance, he goes to the river and set’s a bear skull next to a mostly empty bottle of fire wine on a large stone. He then makes an arrow pointing to the town next to it and starts heading off, he stays in “the salty sardine”.

    Dear Diary, session 23
    The party wakes to Nogmire entering the tent, Grimm heavily hungover from the celebration yesterday. He asks the party as to why is there a pair of giant slippers in the cart. He then notices the great craftsmanship on the cross
    -stitch that alis was doing. As most of the elements of surprise set off into the forest they see a flash of lightning in the far back, they continue onwards. Asa they get further north, a bit of snowfall start to come down. Alis talks with Earheart and learns that he’s hungry, always hungry. They travel for most of the day, until they see smoke and flames far in front of them. People are storming out of the town in hoards, the town burning, screams coming from the inside. As the party (-Stone) jump off and rush in, going against the flow of the people, they see larger folk with blond hair and youthful appearances, murdering people. Clearly an old man and his sons, northerners murdering everyone.
    Roll for initiative
    Grimm runs over bolstering his defences with magic. as he gets hoarded with younglings, the father focuses on Howard as he strikes back. Alis helps Trent breathe lightning on the northerners and they whittle down their numbers and get hurt, mainly trent and grimm. They kill all but one, for later interrogations.
    They go further north, as they were supposed to meet Nogmire at the docks. They notice nothener bandits raiding houses and yeet them to death. Howard throws a handaxe into one’s skull instantly killing it. They get shot at and deal with most of the bandits, one yeets into the window as their leader appears. the leader grabs alis to add to his slave trade but is swarmed by the party. They attack him, being hit back in return.  The last bandit being missed by Howard’s handaxes and finally being burnt by Alis. Nearly killed, the leader runs towards the forest, as Grimm and Howard notice two dire wolves. as they finish of the leader, they slowly back off. They decide to take a short break with trent casting a spell to heal everyone. Alis spots some enemies talking about finding a priest, the party splits up and deals with The northerners, though Trent went down, along with Alice and Grimm, though they get back up and the party manages to deal with them. They spot Stone, slinking down the side of a building, out of a window. A priest exits a house, thanking the party for taking care of the northerners, looking for him. He heals the party and then flees to where the public goes.

    Dear Diary, session 24
    The Elements of surprise are now together, Stone looking worse for the ware. They walk through an alley, noticing a peculiar frost on the walls. They exit to a large street filled with people, the people encased in ice. They look around in the icy street, only to spot an icy small creature riding a big white wolf, with icy steam coming with each breath. A long pause ensues, but then the icy creature’s arm falls off bursting into 4 copies of the original. They strike, combat ensues. Arrows fly and ice creatures get smashed. Eventually the creature riding the wolf casts a spell, engulfing the battlefield in a burst of smoke, too thick to see though. Alis, remembering the fan she has uses it to create a strong wind, that dissipates most of the battlefield, letting the party see what they’re doing. strangely enough though, the wolf is nowhere to be seen. Stone, being on the other side of a still present part of the cloud. climbs a house to keep watch. Trent, Grimm and Howard smash the last remaining ice creatures. As the party continues north, towards the docks, towards Nogmire. They see a flower shaped boom of fire on the northerner ships, and large scale battle waging on against the northerners. A wizardess on the local side defending the intruders, alongside hoards of people. As the northerners are being pushed back, a commander in the midst spots the party, specifically Trent. A large white scaled dragonborn, clearly high in the rankings. A large white dragonborn northerner spots them and starts running towards trent, yelling something about gods. He wants to duel. the party gets decimated and the dragonborn goes away saying he has the powers of Vulkar. Trent and Grimm being icicles. The party meets up with Heleborus, the wizardess that was almost single handedly driving off the northerners. She asks the party to find a ship called The Reverence because it’s captain ows the country a big favour.


    ________________


    Dear Diary, session 25
    The party sets off towards the ship, walking through the wreck and wreckage, the past body carriers. Trent prays to Vulkur. He asks his deity for guidance in finding the ship successfully. Alis notices a person who might be a sailor, definitely looks like one in his shabby sailor’s attire. She approaches, to the casual looking sailor, who bows at her. She asks the man if he might know the Reverance, and he answers. He says, that he, Salty Sal is the captain of the ship. They talk a bit about them not believing that he is indeed the captain, after some discussion they finally come to an agreement, to talk to Barbara, the person who appears to be in debt to the country. They talk some and discuss some and follow the slightly suspicious captain on a rowboat to get to the Revenant. As they’re rowing the party talks some more with the man, of a lot of stuff, strange creatures, sea spawn. and one moment… He gets dragged underwater.
    Roll for initiative
    Suddenly another tentacle reaches out and drags Howard underwater, pulling him unconscious and under the water. Trent gets him back up and throws a handaxe into one of the two creature’s heads. Grimm summons a magical weapon next to one of the things and Stone dives in to help Howard. Howard manages to break free and swims upward, Grimm kills one and then the other creature.
    The now wet people get back on the rowboat. They send firebolts as flares to the sky, to a passing boat. Luckily they’re noticed and the ship turns to them. They find out that the ship is Reverance and the party is questioned by Barbra. Though the party’s documentation is at the bottom of the sea along with Salty Sal the party manages to convince the sailor to let the party go with her.
    The party tries to take a rest but is abruptly interrupted and everyone needs to choose a position to work in. Alis and Stone compete for first mate, Trent is the quartermaster, Grimm is the cook and Howard the Bosun.  As night falls the captain goes to sleep and Howard takes over. When he does so and the deck clears, Stone walks by a bucket, hearing a voice, looking inside he hears a talking fish say “Hey furry boy”. Stone thinks that he has not had nearly enough sleep. He takes the bucket as the fish asks what comes after friday. As the fish is flying over the water a bigger fish jumps out of the water, saturday it says. Stone, thoroughly through, lays down on the planks, right then and there. He takes a look at the sky, trying to remember the star that Lothar would often look at. He lies there scanning the sky, and finally he finds it, a large yellow star. Stone lays there, staring at it, for a time that seems to be more fulfilling than any rest could’ve been, Karcosa, it’s name was Karcosa. He lays there, thinking, and he finally decides he needs actual rest, though he doesn’t feel like it. He goes to his room, and flops down on his bed. He tries to sleep, closes his eyes, in some time he opens them again, this repeats for some time. Until, he opens his eyes to a strange scene. Him, sitting down on a wooden board floating in the ocean, the water still as glass, the sky pitch black. Black, except for one radiant source of light, the star Karcosa, the water glistening slightly. Stone feels a slight pressure on his back, as he is resting against something. He looks back. Stone sees his back resting against Videl’s. Him sitting in the same position as Stone. He says his name is Curtis, when Stone askes why is he here he answers with there being angry  people and treasure. They sit there talking, about the yellow star, Curtis mentions it looking like a crown, and upon closer inspection, so it does. Curtis then reaches up with is hand and reaches out towards the distant star, though his hand stops as if it touches something, and then, he disappears. And so does the world, the night replaced by night. The ocean a pond and the wood a clean marble plate, the sky a lear blue, but where the sun would be, lies the yellow star, Stone sits there in contemplation, and in a few moments, he reaches out as well.

    “Ship! Northerner ship!” Is what the shipmen hear as trent sees the northerner ship approach. As the sunlight starts beaming over the horizon, as it lands on Stone, black tendrils wither away as Stone starts spasming on the ground. And the northerner ship attacks, causing the party to fight them. As they flood aboard the ship their blades flurry striking at the people. Their spellcaster proves to be tougher than the rest, but not too though. The northerners almost taken care of, the party hears sloshing on the sides of the ship and they see fishpeople climbing on board from both sides. A case on either side, one housing a glowing lemon, one housing a glowing bread.  As a fighperson died they grew ever larger, as finally howard reached into a cage, swallowing the bread whole. As the fishpeople die, howard swells in size and gains godly powers and intellect, coursing through the realms and changing reality to his whims. one by one the northerners and fishpeople are defeated, and Howard coughs up the bread.

    Dear Diary, session 27
    As the ship arrives by the mound of ice, protruded by houses and snow topping it off, they sail onwards. “Northeners!” they crew yells. Stone wakes, grabbing Plank Howard, placing him in his bag, head poking out. The party rushes to the deck. The captain tells the party they have until dawn to do what they need to, before they leave. They set off with a rowboat towards  the icy island with buildings like great halls. There is a dock to one side and a noticeable cliff to the other. Using their tried and true method, they go to the cliff, Stone sets the grappling hook and rope and they climb the cliff. They go to the nearest building, climbing to the second floor. There’s a balcony, they go inside, the room is filled with giant furniture, Prominent is a Giant Thrown, hearing nothing the party enters. This proves to be a big mistake, as looking back there are three northerner speakers on the throne, combat ensues. Being 20 feet up on a  throne, certainly helped in protecting them, but not from the floating plank howard, who walloped one. The speakers are taken down one by one, until only one lies standing.  Who then, decides to resurrect the others with her powers bestowed upon her by the queen. And form a door comes strolling in a winter wolf. Alis tries to convince the wolf not to attack as Trent throws a last handaxe to the alive Speaker, killing her and setting off a chain reaction of speakers exploding into ice, doing enough damage to petrify stone in ice and bring Howard back from his plank state. The winter wolf grabs alis in its mouth and carries her off. The others who are still up chase after her but are downed and captured.

    The ice around Stone cracks and drops off, releasing him to the floor in a cold mess. As he does so he sees Trent in prair, He thanks trent immensely as he rests for a moment gathering his bearings. Confused about what transpired while he was gone, Stone asks Trent where everyone is. They’re captured, most likely trying to escape. as they recuperate Stone and Trent hears the voice of howard behind a door, Stone rushes over, as they hear a deep northerner voice. Stone runs in landing a deep gash into him, which he retaliates with a strong smack. Howard punts him and stone slashes, stepping out of the room and the others kill him. Meanwhile alis meets Naal as she tries to escape her prison of ice by repeatedly firing firebolts at it. Grimm manages to climb up after howard ,and reunites with most of the gang. They find their equipment and a climbers kit and grimm picks up trent. They go to each jail hole to find alis and they do, Alis doesn’t want to climb, she wants to go through the ice to. They climb down to the hole and go to help Naal and Alis. Grimm grabs a pickaxe and starts picking. They finally break through to a gust of icy cold blowing into the hole. They enter a large room, with a blue glow, in the middle a large stalagmite and stalactite met at a orb of ice, emmentating this cyan glow. They debate on what to do. They go up the stairs they see and enter what seems to be a ritual room. filled with statues of gods and goddesses and some debris.

    Dear Diary, session 29

    The Elements of Surprise walk on the side of the ice berg and navigate towards the hall building. They navigate icy cliffs, they bass buildings until they reach the steep drop with large chains connecting the two icy cliffs. They tie a rope around themselves and start to walk across the humongous chains. As they're walking they start to lose balance once or twice.
    Alis loses her footing and trips, luckily she's caught by Grimm who saves her from falling into the icy grip of the water below. She takes hold of the
    chains once more and they manouver across the chasm. Finally they reach end enter the same building that they first entered. They enter the second floor.
    Stone decides to explore the second floor, finding the room filled with crates, barrels, chests and a caged giant owl. Stone looks through the chests, he
    finds a frozen dwarf, money and some other stuff.
    ________________

    Dear Diary, session 30

    The party skidaddles out of the building after trading most of their valuables for the bag of holding. They take their boat and ride it around the ice bergtowards the temple. They see Cryovantrics, the white dragon, who's tail is wagging. She then asks the others to help Naal who seems to be casting firebolt against ice, over and over. Cryovantricsseems to be using the party as manual labour at this point. Grimm uses a pickaxe, Nall fire bolts, Stone pulls out a vial of oil, covering the ice with oil. As Nall fires a fire bolt at it the whole thing lights in flame and melts suprisingly quickly. Trent and howard smash the ice with their weapons. As the dragon's hoard is taken and put into the bag, Grimm aproaches. He takes the bag to the dragon. The dragon pauses and asks the dwarf to remove the boots from inside. Hesitant, Grimm does so. He removes a pair of fluffy winter boots. Stone recognises them as what the Zhentarim wizard Nilraun was talking about earlier. They exit the temple, going towards the core. Ulgrimm asks if he can take 10 minutes to identify the boots, the others agrees. Grimm sees a man wearing these boots in harsh winter conditions. These are winter boots that give you resistance to cold. Stone concludes that it is most likely the item that Nilraun was looking for and tells the others that they may be able to trade it in later for something that is of more use for them. They decide that Trent would hit the orb with his handaxe, the orb explodes throwing an icy blast into everyone and Stone looks pretty hurt, along with the others. They hear the petrifying scream of the dragon from afar and they do their best to get to the boat, but Stone is clearly falling behind. He slips and slides on the ice, barely getting past the Northeners, he reaches the docks as the boat is sailing out of it. He jumps towards the boat and falls into the freezing water, he thrashes around trying to grab the ropes thrown to him, hid limbs lock and freeze as Naal jumps into the water to save Stone. Trent throws up a fog cloud. Howard extends an oar to Naal and they finally manage to save Stone. As stone is helped onto the ship he curles up into a ball and starts sobbing. They start rowing away. They get to their boat and notice an absolutely massive warship approaching.
    Alistina is flying with the owl, her efforts to change it's course have been in vain. She sees in the distance a ship whose size is staggering, on it seem to be frost giants. She sees one wrestling a whale down there. The giant in a crows nest points towards alis and does a call, the owl now swooping down landing. The giants voices boom in this massive voice they point towards the owl. They go away leaving the owl, with Alis on its back, she gets off. She hides from any watchful eyes. She does her best to survive. The warship approaches the rowboat and Grimm and Howard do their best to row out of it's way as they see alis on the tip of the ship's birds nest. She jumps out and wings appear on her back as she flies towards the small boat, her essense radiating light. She lands at the boat where the others are.They row back towards their ship. Stone grabs his fire wine and start chugging, and he passes out. The party finally reaches the ship. Trent and Grimm let the others know of what happened on their journey. Stone rests up on the deck, staring up at the stars, namely the yellow king.
    The party reaches the Fort Heleborus, a noble house. Where the wizard of the Reach is from. Because it took 2 days to get there they have some time to rest. Finnally the party meets back up with Sir Nogmire Nogmire takes the party with him as they update him on what has transpired. Everyone goes with Nogmire to the estate. They see wizard towers, fighters, and others. There's also a garden of Heleborus with a variety of weird and wonderous plants. Nogmire has gotten a promotion and leads the party to the barracks. There seem to be adventures from all corners of the globe. The people look interesting, the party has a week to do whatever. Stone trains in finesse weapons, Alsitina asks Nogmire of how to becomes a paladin. Stone trains in finesse weapons, Alsitina asks Nogmire of how to becomes a paladin. Trent asks grimm to add the iron from the longsword that he got from the duel and add it to his warhammer. Grimm does so and later sells his crafted things. Alis goes to train, convintly, she meets two paladins, one halfling, one human. She first goes to talk with the human. A man wearing armor covered in nature figures. And the two have a talk. She asks of paladins, and how he became one. Trent and Howard finish the giant shoes and let Zepherus know they are ready.

    Dear Diary, session 31

    Lady Heleborus had been observing the party on their adventure from her observation tower. Stone looks around to find members of the Zhentarim and finds traces. Grimm asks Stone to buy a healing potion for each of the party members, though his connections he finds a cadet who sells him vontraband healing potions for 100gp. After 8 days Stone recieves the potions. Grimm later goes to talk to Naal who tells him cryptic messages. The party are told by their various people on what they need to do. As the week ends tha party goes to sleep. Alis is jolted awake. She is being hald down and chocked by a creature, as her vision starts to fade, she manages to wriggle free, letting loose a scream that wakes the other party members as she lets loose a burst of fire into the vampire spawn. As the creature sees the party waking it grapples alistina and starts to flee. Stone runs after, grabbing his silver dagger forcing it into the creatures hand. Howard runs out of the tent and punts the vamire type creature. Grimm throws a guiding bolt against him and the others dash out the tent. The vamprie then jumpes to a nearby roof, still carrying Alistina, Stone follows after Alistina reathes fire all over the creature. Trent, Howard and Grimm all stack barrels, they get up in time to see the vampire spawn embedding his teeth into Stone, sapping his very life force(and hp max). The others get onto the roof and try to pummle the creature. Some hit and Stone manages to break free and step back, barely alive. The spawn grabs ahold of alice once more. As he's running away with her he jumps of the roof and is pummeled by Grimm and electrecuted by trent.  After that Howard lands and grapples the spawn. Grimm and Trent land, hitting the creature with blows of magic and weapons. And finally alistina lets loose a bloom of flame onto the spawns back. Scoarching the upper half of his body to a crisp as it's slain.

    Dear Diary, session 32

    The Elements of Surprise mobilise with the platoon, filled with Naal and Nogmire as well. The other commander tells the others that the enemy is 50ft ahead. Nogmire raises and yells to halt and to do a slow approach. In a sudden flash a beast decends onto the party, a manticore with the head of a lion, wings of a bat and tail as spiky as a headhog. Stone catches it in the corner of his eye and steps back, and the manticore lands, finding a dagger thrown into his side. It bites into Ulgrim, who retaliates with a meaty whack of his warhammer. Alistina points her fingers towards the creature and lets loose a molt of fire into the creatures side. Stone runs past, flashing his shortsword into its side. The creature strikes back at both Stone and Grimm. Stone aint taking none of his shit and throws an alchemist's fire onto the manticore. It shrieks as it starts fleeing, they all fire but Stone lands the killing blow, slashind the wings tendons making the creature tumble and fall down dead. As they manage to gather themselves  they nocise the platoon to their side complately dismantled by orcs. The battle continues with the party, it takes a long time and sadly Stone, is lost, as he gets pummled to death. The battle continues, with Naal joining the frey, and they fight. For around a month, Stone's body is kept fresh with gentle reposte, hoping that they could bring him back in the future with a scroll of resurrection or similar device. A month into the battles, and one day, Stone sits up, his fur dark like the midnight sky, in contrast to his previous orange. He looks around, seeing Trent praying to Vulkar, as he has done many times in this past moon. Trent notices him and they reunite the party once more, though clearly changed he is still the Stone they know. Stone tells the others of the marvles of the yellow king who brought him back, similar to how Vulkar is for trent or Moradin is for Ulgrimm. They rejoice and have a drink, though for some frustrating reason all of Stone's drinks s?eem to be empty.

    Dear Diary, session 33

    The party heads off to the battlefield once more after the heartfelt reunion and a rest. There, in the trench, Stone explores his newfound magical abilities, which include, but are not limited to: creating magical weapons out of thin air and casting spells. A mist rolls over the edge of the moat, with a whirlwind, making it difficult to see. Suddenly a burst of elecricity hits howard, as a living sleet storm pummles into him. The party is tough, but with clever use of spells that move air and tactics. As the creature falls to pieces Alistina collects ome of its innerds, that appear to be crystals. Then they hear northener cries, as they see to the north side of the battlefield overwhelmed with the enemys. Falling back, Grim, Howard and Stone take cover in the trench, without Alis and Trent for they were gathering the crystals still. The enemy group split into three groups, targeting different people, with Howard nearly going down in a stroke of bad luck. The part that did so was neatly disposed of. The main group with the leader spearmen went behind the second one, which got taken care of by trent and Alis, with Grimm holding the flank. Their numbers whittled down the leader faced off against most of the party, and eventually and inevetablywas taken down. The group gathered their things, quite tired and with a storm on the horizon they killed a huge blue frog, from who's body came 4 ice mephits. Then, they got some rest. Resting in a tent, with a storm outside they recieved word via telepathy, of platoon 4 needíng help. Being the helpful people that they are, though being ordered to helped with the decision, they started to head back to camp and take care of platoon 4 on the way. The storm was heavy and visibility near gone, Grimm had the good idea to tie a rope around eachother to not lose trace. After walking for what felt like ages in the freezing cold, only one thung sends a chill down their spine, the sight of a platoon 4 member, being whailed on by a giant ice creature. As the party aproached they felt pangs of cold and chills as icy tendrils stabbed everyone who approached. The party went to work trying to kill the giant creature, though Howard was the only one to reliably hit it. It took a long time and exhausted them all, with several putting their lives on the line and nearly loosing it, but finally, the creature fell and The Elements of Surprise could take a relieved breath, along with the remainging members of platoon 4 of course. (the Goliath's name is Mjolnir)


    ________________

    Dear Diary, session 34

    The elements of surprise manage to trudge along through the snow with a few platoon 4 members to the base, Grimm carrying Trent props him up on a wall. They rest for a bit until Nogmire can gather everyone. They head off and luckily manage to avoid combat until they reach a gigactic hemisphere of wind, and with a wave, Nogmire parts it slightly to let people through. As it is parted a gust of warm and soothing air exits. The people enter and look around, they see three tents and a lot of burning braziers. The party has a needed long rest and feel slightly rejuvinated. Alistina is contacted in her dream by Seraphina, also big dusty. The two talk about Alistina and her powers and experiences. Before leaving Seraphina gives Alistina a bit of wizdom. "Soon it will grow warmer, as you venture further east. The salamander waits for you, he loves you so." They wake.  THey take a walk around the perimiter as Alis notices a blue sheen behind the wind wall, a light resembling Erheart's. Then, it dissapears. In a few moments a one eyed northener jumps out with a flame in his hand and eye. It restrains Stone with magic and then pop out several spearmen, a total of 4 large groups, from each corner of the Sphere. The one eyed northener has 3 illusions that stop several of the party's attacks.

    Dear Diary, session 35

    There seems to be a page that was spilled inc on so badly it was unsalvagable...
    Luckily, there's an attached page, cliped to teh back of this one, in a neat and feminine handwriting.
    Copy from Alistina's diary.

    End of Winter

    Upon our return to Fort Helleborus, I decided to read the book that the guys brought back from the mansion back in Camor. I spent my days reading inside of Lady Helleborus's tower, waiting to speak to her. On the fourth day, she did turn up and we had a brief chat. I showed her the Living Spell Shards, which she thanked me for. She explained that these are a very new 'creation' from our Northern neighbours and that only small ones have been seen last year.
    A little later on, we attended a ceremony of sorts. Lady Helleborus gave a speech about the protection of the reach and then she started listing off names. Mostly officers and the like. She then called my name as well and I received a Medal of Vulkar (Bravery). I felt incredibly nervous but also proud of all of my friends for what we had accomplished. As she pinned the medal on me, she leaned in and told me "I will see you in Cyn."
    Over the next few days we finished up our duties in the fort and said our goodbyes. The book taught me the cantrip "Ray of Frost", a cantrip that allows one to slow an assailant down.
    Today is the 5th of Sylval 1338AF, if all goes well we arrive in Attila on the 8th of Sylval. We were attacked by pirates earlier today. They rammed our ship and the damages caused by the impact have forced us to sail into shallower waters in an effort to fix the ship. We will make use of their makeshift cove.
    The First Mate, Ahohako, explained that there was once a demon named Byzantic who lurked in the waters. He possessed a child who had washed up ashore. He believes that the demon cannot possess one of his own people and as such chose the child. The child is a small boy with long, dark brown hair. After the possession, the child fled into a cave at the center of the island. The princess of the island, Tiabeanie, went mad and in turn, turned Popoki the captain into what he was when he attacked us, a rather insane and strange man. Ahohako told us that he and Popoki were to fight for Princess Tiabeanie's hand in marriage prior to these events.
    Tiabeanie is some sort of spellcaster who turned the royal family (which is her own family) of her island into "Balls of hatred". I had asked Ahohako if they looked like Erhart, but he confirmed they did not. She went mad after a child from a shipwreck that had washed up ashore got possessed by the demon Byzantic. Before these events, she was to wed the First Mate Ahohako.
    We have promised to help them out with this situation, as Tiabeanie has threatened all of the crew with their lives if they did not bring something of use back for her.

    Page end.

    Dear Diary, session 36 Final Page in Stone's handwriting

    The party rests a bit with the queue. Trent eats a crab, Grimm spies, Alistina thinks Sal is on the island and on the top of a mountain. She tries to go off alone, A local informs Grim, seeing this, that the top of the mountain is where Tiabeanie is. Approaching the mountain, they see a shabby, yet tall, wooden tower ontop of it. Guarded by two guards at the enterance, who look unnerved. Tiabene stands at the top. She tells Stone, who's disguised as a local, that he needs to build the tower. Stone tries asking a guard why she's building this tower, but she gets agry and instantly kills the guard. Then combat begins and balls of rage come out, attatching themselves to many of the party. They kill the balls with due time and climb up the tower, where they find out she worships the yellow king, though, clearly of a lower rank. Stone tries to persuade her to stop, but she doesn't so she's knocked out using teamwork and a maul. After resting, they go towards the middle of the island where the posessed kid should be. They approach the low lake and Stone notes how he doesn't want to touch teh water. Alistina finds a hermit crab, which she's been looking for. They see a big rock in the middle of the shallow lake and approach, Stone hesitantly follows. They find a cave in the middle of the rock, leading down. Luckily this part is not submerged. They follow the cave down. They follow the cave down. They come across purple cristal chuncs, which stone stows away in his bag. Alistina is quiet as a mouse and hears some thunks from further beyond, in an opening 10 ft down into the large cave. Dropping down into the  cave with a plop, they see a large cavern with a gigantic hunk of purple crystal sitting in flowing water. Floating above the water is Videl Blasting the crystal with molts of translucent energy... He does not reckognize the party except for Stone. The tabaxi sees a pequliar Ion stone above his head, and he needs it, he knows he does. The other party members are confused a nd clearly want to engage in combat. Stone shoots Alistina a glaare as shes clearly readying a fire bolt, whilst Sv to hold videl's attention. Well, lng story shirt, Alistina fires the firebolt and combat ensues. Videl goes and throws us around and nearly killes us, all while avoiding our hits with a forcefield. The party batters him with attacks as stone goes invisible ans sneaks next t Videl, grabbing the floating stone from the air. Around the sdame time they approach breaking the forcefield. With a cuordinated flurry of fire, mauls and guiding bolts. Videl gets knocked back. As this happens. Space around Stone's bag and the gigantic purple crystal. Confused, but for a moment, the party sees these stange implike creatures jumping out of Stone's bag. The cavern wayning and close to collapsing. Stone runs back into the cave they came from. The others see black inq-y tendrils bursting out from the purple gem. They start fleeing the cavern. The floor shaking and a loud thuming in persuit. Though the fastest and mostly outside, The others easily pass him and and a tendril wraps itself aroiund Stone's foot and pulls him down. This was the last of him the party saw as the cavern opening collapses.

    This is the story of Elliott Abbodon cawly, I found this Journal through my contacts in the Zhentarim and believe The elements of surprise are able to help me in my matters.

    As The elements of surprise, at least what remains of them, reaches Atilla. Bit battered they exit the ship, Trent and Grimm notice a certain flaming Salamander on the docs. They both run towards alice to see who can deliver the news first. Grimm barely reaches Alistina first as her eyes open wide and she realizes that she's wearing worn and maimed clothing. She immediatly takes cover behind the two and starts crawling to her cabin. She puts on a dress and with the help of Stormsword manages to look very presentable. She and Sal reunite with a kiss, slightly interrupted by Trent they decide to go on a date. The others go and get some equipment, while doing so, grimm feels rustling in his bag. When he opnes it, the toy soldier, suddenly active, jumps out and starts runnning, the others give chase, yet it is speedy and manages to evade the others into an abandoned looking house.  They follow, Sal and Alis still on a date somewhere. They enter to see Elliott, a human leaning on a barrel smoking his pipe exasparated. Behind him the toy soldier pushes a snowglobe down to the floor. In a flash of light they are all on a snowy field. They look around, both at the snowy landskape and the pipe smoking human and his pet. He blinks a couple of times looking around and gets to know everybody. He introduces himself as an traveling alchemist and beginner arcanist. Grimm spots a large monument in the snow covered with arcane sigils in a dwarven script. "GIBBERISH" Grimm exclaims, but Elliott recognized the script as Gnome-ish like his master, and interprets the sigils to make sure that when people appear, they appear here specifically. There is also written that to escape from here they have to get two keys. Looks like they'll have to cooperate. They decide to follow the small toy soldier tracks to what looks like an icy glacier. Elliott deduces from the snow not being cold and using his alcehmist tools that this is not a natural formation or materials. They enter and Howard sees a giant Mammoth covered in Ice and decides it would be a great material source for boots. He starts hacking at the "ice" that it encompasses. Starts being gacious, takes down his pants and lets out a man sized turd, which procedes to form into a version of howard and exclaim "I'm poop Howard!". Elliott is extremely distressed by this, but more so by the mechanical dragon that comes around the corner and fires a beam of thunder at him and one of the Howards. They start fighting and with many well placed blows they take it down. Elliott takes a look at it and deduces that this whole area is made by a gnome. they continue onwards to fing a hoard of gold and items. A scrollcase, armor, vase and sword as well as a pile of gold. They take time to inspect everything and continue onto the next area. They arrive at a battlefield, on one side red automata and the other, blue automata.

Howard found a peddler selling a brass acordion for 100 gp, he haggled it down to less than 50. After buying it the seller dissappeared into dust leaving Howard and Grimm stunned. Trying to identify it only revealed a sad tune from the instrument.
    Whilst collecting materials to make acid Trent and Elliott come accross Gale, doing some sort of magical ritual. They witness Gale first teleporting to them. Gale looks at Elliott and sniffs teh air, walking around him in circles. He seems to divinate facts out of thin air this way about him. This unnerves him so he tries to distance himself. Eventually The Elements of surprise sets off to continue their journey of nogmerian adventures.
