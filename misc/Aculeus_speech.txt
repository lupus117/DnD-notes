*bow*
Mistress, let us talk.
This world, it's unique, not because of the shadows and ills, but in spite of them. Have you ever seen a lily bloom neath a winter tree, the white so distinctly different from the lifeless cold surrounding it. The world, it is a place that can flourish even after what... who it has been though. But it needs that tree for shade, shelter for miracles. A fire needs a spark after all. I am here to free you, free the land. You, most of all must know what i mean. This place is a husk, stripped and seperated from what could be. What WE could be.
*removes cloak*
I am here to help spark the wildfire, the one to reignite the life of this land and restore wilderness. Let us work together for both our sakes.
