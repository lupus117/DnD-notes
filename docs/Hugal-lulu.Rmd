### Backstory

After being rescued from devils by the Kaelian mage Sylvira Savikas. Sylvira took it upon herself to recovery Lulu's memories while searching for a means to unlock a puzzlebox that came into her possession. A venture that has taken them from Kaelia to Port Solyma and if they weren't interrupted they would have gone to Euriel afterward. How Lulu might communicate this information to the rest of the party:

“I don’t remember…” “I don’t remember…” “I’m sorry, I don’t remember, Sylvira says something broke my head and it makes everything really confusing…” sad toot
“I came here, to Port Solyma with my friend Sylvira Savikas. She rescued me from a really mean ice devil.”
“Sylvira is really nice lady with pretty red skin and nice horns and a cute tail that she doesn’t like to show off. Oh! And she’s also a very good mage with a talking head for a spellbook.” Lulu nods wisely with a happy toot at the memory.
“Sylvira was helping me recover my memories and looking for a way to open a puzzlebox she has, so we came to Mercia from her tower in Kaelia and…” Lulu stops talking and looks down sadly
“Umm, ye… We followed them down into the catacombs and then and then they attacked us. They hurt Sylvira and she told me to run an-and I ran and ran and I got lost in the tunnels until I found another way out and there was a shrine and it was so green and then they saw me when I came out the ground and chase me and then I found you.” The little elephant-like creatures pace around in circles and collapse around themselves like a ball of golden fur

Lulu only has a few fragmentary memories of the time before her amnesia:

- Flying over a vast, dark ocean. The water reflecting a sky filled with diamond-like stars. In the black depths below, a huge whale seemingly made from golden motes of light swims through the darkness.
- Looking out a window made from gems set into silver and gold, across a verdant landscape where metallic dragons flit through the sky.
- The smiling face of a blindfolded golden-haired woman with ivory wings. A friend she doesn't remember.
- Flying over a boundless expanse of black, cracked basalt. A single-file line of strange, polyhedral-shaped creatures marches below, stretching from horizon to horizon.
- A busy marketplace carved from a cliff-face. She was speaking to a winged lion with the kind-yet-stern face of a man.
- Marching with an army of knights through a desolate wasteland against an army of monsters.
- Sometimes this feels like a magician’s trick: She remembers riding through a crimson portal, seeing a blasted plain stretched out in front of her, and then… Everyone is gone and she’s all alone.
- A silver beach beneath a pair of blue moons. Sometimes she remembers her warrior angel being with her there.
- The taste of blood and fur in her mouth.

## flashbacks

### a

Ariel riding atop Lulu, her war elephant, were on a green grass, infront of us is a similar fleshy growth "hell portal'. 
Zariel calls out to someone to into the portal, Lulu felt she couldn't look away from it almost in a trance. 
Zariel shouts mentioning a name Lulu could not recall, "...he has taken one of our own! charge into the portal and him him back!" 
we all charge into the portal... memory ends.

### b

A Demonic knight of Palor called her name for a boon

### C

Zariel's testifying... she's screaming... someone's on trial... "your betrayal, Ashmendale, will cost!... i will speak my truth!"

## Gideons testement {.book}

> The overwhelming theme of the book regards the evils of demons:

The Woman: Tell me, O Master, of what is the greatest evil.  
Gideon: It is that of the Abyss. It is the teemless horde of chaos which seeks to rip down civilization.  
The Woman: And why should civilization be not destroyed?  
Gideon: Civilization is that which gives life meaning. It is the font of morality and thought. Of art and of science.

> Great praises are heaped upon those divinities which stand stalwart against this demonic threat:

It is the gods’ place to stand between Man and Chaos. It is their aegis which is their ultimate purpose, for behind their shield we create greatness and dedicate it to their honor.

> One night, however, Gideon awakens from a strange and formless dream and sees a disturbing vision in his bedchamber:

There I beheld her. Her beauty was so great it seemed to burn my eyes. And yet through my blindness I could see her with greater clarity than any other sight that I have ever beheld.  
Two great wings of white she had. And a sword of celestial steel so sharp that I could hear the hum of its edge. A weapon made to cleave the division between soul and mind.  
But then I saw this essence of perfection cast away her sword. Her wings turned black. Her eyes turned to pits of fire. And a great and terrible purpose furrowed her brow.

> The next day he speaks with the Woman in White, who tells him that she, too, has had a vision of this angelic being, and that its name is Zariel.

Gideon: But why should she have turned from the light?  
The Woman: She turned from the light because it blinded her.  
Gideon: Does not the light let us see?  
The Woman: That is the lie of the light. We think only of what it illuminates, but not of what it conceals from us.

> Gideon realizes that the Great Blindness – the Great Lie — is that the gods protect man from chaos:

… but it is not so! Pelor? Selune? Bahamut? Kord? His children? None of them battle the Abyss. They claim the glory of that war, but shed no blood in it!  
This is why Zariel turned from Heaven. She saw the truth of her holy purpose; the Great Need to stand against Chaos. And she saw that her “holy” power was powerless because her gods had willed it so. Thus she allied herself with Hell! For it is Hell who fights chaos! It is Hell which sacrifices itself in the Blood War! Hell which fights eternal so that we poor mortals may eke out a few years of freedom upon the mortal plane!

> Zariel is, thus, the inordinate exemplar of both sacrifice and surface. Gideon has nothing but praise for her, for the choice she made, and for the great work which she does in the service not only of the mortal races, but for the balance of the entire multiverse.

Without her, all would become Chaos. And all those who do not stand with her are servants and abettors of Chaos, though they know it not.
