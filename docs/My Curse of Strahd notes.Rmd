#### The stolen bones of Saint Andral   
The bones of St Andral have kept the church safe from harm, free from fiends and undead.
This all changed when the gravedigger **Milivaj** Needed money to feed the children in the orphanage.

He sold it to someone wealthy, leaving it in a bush in front of a dilapidated house, later finding 350 gp where it was.

Current suspects are the Wachter's.
 
#### The Heroics of Saint Andral  {.book}
*A large runestone dons the wall as you enter the church. It reads in common:*

The Story of St Andral.

**Andral Karsten** was the morninglord priest of New Valekia, the wealthiest and most populous town in the valley. He was a most holy man who believed the church of the Morninglord should use its resources to care for the poor rather than hoard its wealth. Unfortunately, the exposed position of New Valekia meant the town was easy prey for the hordes of beastmen who used to plunder the valley. Father Andral was therefore a **tentative ally of the Von Zarovich family**, who pledged to drive the beastmen away. Andral was wary of Barov von Zarovich’s ambitions though, especially after he proclaimed himself king on no authority other than his own. He could never quite articulate his suspicions of Strahd, but they ran even deeper. However, even Father Andral had to concede that Strahd was a tactical genius whose martial abilities far exceeded his father’s. With Strahd commanding the armies of the valley, Father Andral began to hope that his people might one day be free.



But after Strahd drove the beastmen out of the eastern valley, they fell hard on New Valekia, occupying the town and using it as their last stronghold. Father Andral led the townsfolk in passive resistance against them, for which he was taken captive. The beastmen tortured him for seven days and seven nights, commanding him to renounce his faith, but he never wavered. On the dawn of the eighth day, Strahd’s armies arrived outside New Valekia and purged the beastmen, but the aid came too late: Andral was dead. After his martyrdom, the people of New Valekia began to venerate Father Andral, he **ascended to saintdom** and became celestial. With his ascension he came to consecrate his surroundings all of which he touched, protecting this church from the forces of evil to this very day.


#### Studies on the life of St Markovia   {.book}
*A book which Lucien gave the party reads*  
**Sister Markova** never trusted the Von Zaroviches. She didn’t like the way they claimed everything in the valley as theirs—even her fellow nun at the **Abbey of Krezk**, Sister **Tasha Petrovna**, whom King Barov Von Zarovich conscripted as his family healer. King Barov’s personal priest, Ciril Romulich, was a greedy and venal man who couldn’t cast a cantrip to save his own life, and Barov brought his army to the gates of the abbey and demanded the monks **hand over Sister Tasha** after word of her **healing touch** spread. Fortunately, he did not know that Sister Markovia had a similar gift.



She pleaded with anyone who would listen, the Krezkovs, the **Basarab-Idostrovnas**, Father Andral –not to support him. But she was safe behind the walls of the abbey, and the people of New Valekia and Krezk were not, and soon they **all turned to King Barov and his son Strahd** to drive out the beastmen.



Sister Markovia watched from her abbey as Strahd first liberated the valley, then consolidated his power, then turned on his allies. 



When word reached Krezk that Strahd had risen from his grave and become undead, **Sister Markovia**, who by this time had become head of the abbey, knew she could wait no longer. She **declared open revolt against Strahd**, and the faithful of Krezk rallied to her. **Strahd responded** by sending a pack of his new spawn to slay her and **raze the abbey**. Much to his surprise, she repelled them with holy magic and righteous fury. She then led a **march on Ravenloft**, gathering more followers along the way. Even the people of Barovia, the **Order of Silver Dragon** and the ancestral homelands of the Von Zaroviches joined her army. She very nearly ended Strahd’s reign almost as soon as it began.



No one knows exactly what happened in Castle Ravenloft, but **she was never seen again**. The few stragglers from her army limped back to the abbey with the terrible word. The brothers and sisters knew they could not stand against Strahd, but they canonized Markovia and renamed the abbey in her honor, a quiet act of resistance against their undying tyrant. Then they closed the doors and settled in for the long siege. The act of honoring St Markovia's heroism might have made her **acencion to  celestial saintdom**, if she even acended at all. Markovia's acencion is a mystery still debated to this day.

### Kolyan Indriovich's Letter {.book}
Hail thee of might and valor,

I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor - with despair. My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer. So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours. There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.

Kolyan Indirovich
Burgomaster

#### My most pathetic servant {.book}
My most pathetic servant,

I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.

You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a bastard son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.

Your dread lord and master,

Strahd von Zarovich 

#### Cultists' letter {.book}

I don't know how much longer I can hold on with this. Why My Lord was I able to be persuaded into duing these dastardly deeds. The priest i Village Barovia is preaching that you have left our land My Morning Lord. I like my fellow barovians are waiting out for your Messiah. Don't abandon me because of this operation, My Lord. Let The Shepard come soon.

#### Suicide note {.book}

My Beloved Children,

I wish I could do what all fathers do and tell you that monsters aren’t real. But it wouldn’t be true.

Life can create things of exquisite beauty. But it can also twist them into hideous beings. Selfish. Violent. Grotesque. Monstrous. It hurts me to say that your mother has turned into one such monster, inside and out. And I’m afraid the disease that afflicted her mind has taken hold of me as well.

It sickens me to think what we’ve put you through. There is no excuse. I only ask of you, though I know I do not have the right to do so, to try and forgive us. I despise what your mother has become, but I love and pity her all the same.

Rose, I wish I could see you blossom into a strong, beautiful woman. Thorne, Walter, I wish I could be there for you. But I can’t. This is the only way.

Goodbye.

My Dear **Mrs Petrovna**,

Your advice on dealing with the unwanted fiend in my home is very good advice indeed.

Legendary hunter of beasts. He was blessed with long life by a litch. He studied the arts of hunting, creating potions, medicine and writing his research down.
Erazmus, his child was killed by him after being turned into an undead.

#### notes from diary {.book}
*In Van Richten's study was his burnt diary, only a few pages ledgible.*

  For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the purifying light of truth and knowledge. "Hero" I am named in some circles; **"sage"** and **"master hunter"** I am called in others. That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes. 
  
  In truth, this "virtuous" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a **vampire** that **murdered my child**, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich. I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but weather I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.   
  
  I expect that those who think me a hero will change their minds when they know the whole truth about my life as a hunter of the supernatural. Nevertheless, I must reveal, here and now, that I have been the indirect yet certain cause of many deaths and the loss of many good friends. Mistake me not! I do not merely feel sorry for myself. Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I see now that I am the object of a baleful **Vistani curse**. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who **surround me have fallen victim** to it!
  
  I have related the tragic story of how my only **child Erasmus was taken by Vistani and sold to a vampire**. I explained how Erasmus was made a minion of the night stalker, and how it was my miserable part to free him from that fate at the point of a stake, What have i neglected to illuminate before is how i tracked Erasmus's kidnappers across the land, or how I "extracted" Erasmus's whereabouts from them.
  In fact, the Vistani that took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill member of their tribe to me one evening.
  
  ***
  
  and insisted that I treat him, but I was **unable to save the young man's life**. In fear of their **retribution**. I begged the **Vistani to take anything** of mine if only they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they chose to surreptitiously **take my son in echchaange** for their loss! By the time I realized what had occurred They were already an hour gone.  
  
  Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly **followed the Vistany** caravan through the woods, naively allowing the **sun to set before me** without seeking shelter from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was **beset by undead** that would have slain me, had not their master, **a litch, intervened and spared my life**, for reasons I do not completely understand. He somehow detected me and with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of zombies that wondered in the forest. He spoke to me throufh the mouths of the dead things and placed a **magic ward against undead on me**, then animated the dead things and placed a magic warf against undead on me, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it to tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (i say in hindsight), the plan worked. I found the child-stealeres, and ny unwelcome entourage included a growinf horde of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich's ward.  
  
  When I found the caravan, I threataned ro set the zombies on the Vistani unless returned my dear boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.  
  
  Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed ne, saying. "Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath theur claws!" Even now, so many years later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart. The darkness had torn him from my loving arms forever, and I foolishly believed that the curse had exacted its deadly toll. I wept until an insatiate desire for vengane filled the bottomless rift in my heart.

### Birth and childhood
I've been told my mother **Umbra** and father **Fenrin** were an unlikely pair, one a brooding noble working as a knight and one a druid who cared for the forests nearby. 
My father never blamed me for what happened, my __mother dying in childbirth__, though the medics say she was gone for most of the night before I first cried out a breath.
It was a dark moonless night, or so it was supposed to be, had the __moon not lit a red hue__ on the land below.
It didn't help that my mother was rumored to be dealing in dark rituals, as city folk often are suspicious of the rarer magics and druids were rare in cities. Nothing was ever confirmed of dark rituals and my father protected her honor to all his ability.    
Though I was fed and taken care of, I never felt in place in that dingy city, not with the rumors that lay around me and my family, the hushed whispers and stares, my unnaturally white hair only making it worse.
Maybe they were right in condemning me, people seemed to get hurt around me, shrinking back whenever they felt my unnaturally cold skin. But what could i do about it... 

Umbra Floreo | Fenrir Floreo
---|---
<image src="../Barovia/Umbra.png" class="token" > | <image src="../Barovia/Fenrir1_5.jpg" class="token" >
Kindhearted druid of the **Wildmother**, died giving birth to Aculeus under a red moon | Ex knight and diplomat, father of Aculeus. A kind and charismatic man.
  
### Teen years and a grove of druids:
Once I grew of age to depart on my own. I said goodbye to my father, though no tears were shed by either party for we knew it was for the best. 
I left to follow the same path my mother came to the city with, through two harsh moons I reached a circle of druids, where i first say the gentle magics of the druids.  
I had entered the __circle of Dreams__, where i spent the next decade of my life, the ways that once seemed strange, the whispers of sylvan that made the world bloom now becoming clearer.
I grew to love the flowers that lined the grove and people who were so kind and unjudgemental. 
As I saw animals and friends get hurt, I learnt to heal, through herbs and potions and a hint of magic.

### A red night
One cold night a **red moon** rose again, leaving with it a **dream**, one that would lead me to my new family... and Barovia.

Your dreams take you and you realize you are in a forest. In front of you is a rare light violet flower. The flower peaks your interest and you study it until you are interrupted by **Crocus**, who is strangely chirping more violently than normal. When you notice and look up at Crocus, you also see that a strange fog has surrounded you withing this forest grove. The forest seems much more dark now than when about a minute ago, you start to head back. The mist is obscuring you way forward and you almost find it hard following the way home to the Circle of Dreams. Your walk turns into a light jog as you swear the mist is providing resistance in your strides forward.

When you are almost home, you distinguish some beams of light piercing the mist from were the encampment is. You speed up your movement as you now see the darker shade of mist rising towards the sky from the encampment, only it is not mist but black smoke rising. As you move you start to hear the fire and agonized wails coming form The Circle. 

The wind dashes you with cold and humidity as you struggle to move forth through the fog. As you break though the misty veil you witness a horrible scene. The encampment is ablaze, half dead people and corpses of both the druids and your peers litter the ground.  A dozen **vile, feral humanoid creatures feed from the peoples' necks** and continue the desecration of this holy site of nature. 

One person stands out among the chaos. **A tall man, back towards you with fine garments and a long maroon cape** facing The **Fane**, your Circle's shrine to The Wildmother. The Fane lies desecrated and broken while the man stands proudly and victorious. The man turns towards you and locks eyes. Though you can not see his face, for it is obscured by shadow, you still see his jet black hair and snow white complexion. You feel his red eyes piercing you with a look. His face forms a grin and he raises a hand up in the air. This prompts all the creatures to stop feeding from the corpses and turns their attention to you.

The man clenches his fist, which prompts his spawn to start sprinting towards you. You manage to shoot a some of your assailants with your crossbow, but you are quickly overwhelmed and fall to the ground with a pile atop. When you are pressed into the ground it seems as the ground rots and gives into the weight, causing you to sink like quicksand from under you. Like falling through rotten branches the ground breaks, opening into an endless dark abyss as you start falling. The vile spawn above you fall as well and you feel your soul sinking, until you reach dark nothingness.

From out of oblivion, the vestige of an **old woman appears** before you. The woman is **wearing colorful robes of yellows and oranges**. She opens her mouth and speak with a broken accent: **"I see you Aculeus."** She raises a hand and magically shuffles a deck of cards, plucking out one of them and making it float towards you. **"One born from our land, hiding to alter it forever. Will you restore it or let it be I wonder?"** The card flips over. It's a pictured card with the text: The Transmute "Travel to the village of Idsmouth. Find the other." 

After those words you are shot out of you dream. You wake into your bed at an untouched Circle of Dreams, drenched with cold sweat and breathing heavy. On your bedside table, you see a card flipped down. Upon further inspection, it's The **Transmuter**


### The Departing
When I woke to find the card of **the transmuter**, lying on my bedside counter, I grew afraid. What was this dream, no... a vision. I sat upon the bed for a good while, pondering what transpired. Strange grew the quiet, Crocus was nowhere around.
He had disappeared in the night, he left and came as he pleased. He knows how to find me, I thought since he always had. I gathered the few belongings i had, deciding to pay heed to the old womans omen, stashing the card I'd been so keenly observing.
I went to the Shrine of the Wildmother for the last time, taking my time and raising a patch of narciccuses and wildflowers. The other druids would know why i had left, a new beginning, a rebirth to protect them and whoever i could from befalling to the omens.
Off I set towards the tiny town of Idsmouth. The journey was a distance of two moons. My only companion during that time were the plants of the land and Crocus, well the rare few times he was with me. But I reached it, determined to heed the dreams.


## The Transmuter

### The Transmuter {.book}
<image src="../Barovia/Transmuter.png" >  
*Aculeus, born of the land. And believe me they have their eyes on you.*  
*The card of change. Seek a hill with monuments of stone, let guide you wings of ravens.*  
*There you shall find what you seek.*

### A stranger in a strange land
Upon crossing the boundary to **Barovia** Aculeus felt a shift. His eyes would gleam in the dark like those of a feline's. He gained the ability to see in pitch black darkness. But that was not all. For he found powers and magic of an unknown origin. 

### Visions from a vistani
When the party visited *Madam Eva* the vistani fortuneteller who appeared in their dreams and invited them to **Barovia** in the first place. Aculeus had his fortune told... "child of the land... what does that mean?... And who will have their eyes on me"

### A lost Fane
Following the **Raven** (read as **Muriel Martikov**) into the forest, a puzzling sight greets Aculeus' eyes.
Guided to a shrine of stone, a **Fane of the Wildmother**, a feeling of desecration and ruin came over Aculeus as he sees the **abandoned and overgrown** monoliths covered in moss and dust. Aculeus promises himself and the Wildmother his return, following the party towards Vallaki.

### A dreamy Fane
That night in the **Bluewater Inn** Aculeus has a **dream...**
Opening his eyes, Aculeus looks around at the leaves fluttering in the wind and the **myriad of plants** surrounding stone obelisks. It takes a moment to recognize, as the world of Barovia and its plants seem sapped of all colors and life, but these are the same obelisks as before... **A Fane of the Wildmother**. But as it's supposed to be, one with the world around it, with the life blooming under his feet. As Aculeus turns around, his eyes meet another. 

Though Aculeus was shocked, he was not discouraged, as this was a sign, that he was on the right path. As the **dryad** drew closer, she spoke with a soft and enchanting tone, telling Aculeus of this land. That Aculeus has to be the one to **get rid of the Defilement of the land**. For after all, **he was one of them**. Still inching closer, she lay a hand on his cheek and told him of her sisters the other fanes, **Swamp** and **Mountain**. Aculeus promised seek them out and **restore them**, for how could he not. With a smile, the fane kissed him, a gentle kiss, the first one he's had. And with that he woke. Discovering his skin bearing barklike texture and ears elven sharpness. 

### Dreams of a tree(possibly swamp fane)
After the encounter with beastpeople at the winery, Aculeus dreamed.  
He dreamed of chasing green form of a fane.
They ran through forest, diving into water after, chasing through trees, looking more and more desecrated. The fane then standing in front of a big dark tree, her gray decayed form of the avatar frowning slightly at me.


### Gifts from the fanes
3 gifts were given to the Martikovs, gems that make the land grow green. All now taken. It might be possible to use these to restore the fanes and the land. Have to find them first though.

* One lost ages ago  

* One lost track of by **Urwin Martikov** 15 years ago  

* ~~One stolen by the **Beast people** and the **Matron** less than a week ago to a large hill to the roads south of the winery.~~ Recently retrieved

## Old Blood
The blood that flows through Aculeus' veins is special, the same one that flowed through his mother and her sister. It makes you one with the land, being a part of it, drawing from it. Though now the land is tainted in Strahd's darkness, it was once the land of **Melora, the wildmother** and will be once again.

### Umbra Floreo
She fled from her sister, taking residence with the Martikovs for a while. They cared for her, until she left Barovia, following a prophecy. Kindhearted druid of the **Wildmother**, died giving birth to Aculeus under a red moon 

### The Matron
Sister of **Umbra** follower of Strahd. She has the same type of powers as Aculeus.
